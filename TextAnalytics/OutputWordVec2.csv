"1","This monitor is very sharp and clear as you would expect.  Unlike some of the reviewers with negative comments I was able to get it running at 4k resolution with 60hz.  My fundamental issue is not with those things like many others.  My issue is like one reviewer called a ""Milky white"" hue over the entire monitors image.  I've tried every combination of cables, Calibration on my 15 Retina Macbook pro (Summer 2014) and there is nothing that i can do to get this monitor to produce the color black or anything close to being acceptable as black.  For this reason I can't give it more than 2 stars even though in every other way (only after 2 days using it) it seems to be pretty darn good for the price.My next issue is that I spent an hour submitting and resubmitting my case to the Asus website... which did everything it could to make my entering of information difficult and  ensure I was human but didn't do nearly enough to actually accept and process my case. All I could get after doing this approximately 4 times with a ton of issues along the way, was an error after the submission with no other feedback.  I assume that because i never got an email from them saying the case was received that I had done this so many times for no reason at all.  And I refuse to sit on the phone for hours and hours getting little to no help like the other reviewers with issues did.  I'm extremely technical and did everything possible to save this monitor from needing to go back but not having the color black and living with everything looking like it has a white film over it is unacceptable for a 600 dollar piece of equipment, especially when the 170 dollar Samsung WUXGA monitor next to it has much better color while not being special enough to sit on the same desk.I really really wish I could fix this issue but this doesn't appear to be driver related etc.Just to frame it up I used DP 1.1 and 1.2 configurations (Monitor's menus), am using a 2014 MBP retina 15 (4k@ 30 and 60hz) and a 2013 MBP retina 13 (only runs at 2560x1600).  I went through the Mac display expert mode calibration process and managed to get the monitor to the best image i could manage.  After not looking at another monitor while using it this yielded semi-acceptable results.... except when you put up anything with black being a major part of the color palette.  This is where it all falls apart and i become Extremely disappointed and highly annoyed for every second i have to look at these 'dark grey blacks'.The image i have attached is the result of many hours of tweaking and calibrating.  The picture was in a poorly lit room so the monitor is getting more credit than it deserves but the one on the right is the Asus PB287Q and the one on the right is a 170/dollar 24 inch samsung with hardly any inputs of features (running at 1900x1200).  You can see that this 'best' image i could derive out of the Asus hardly passes for black when compared to the Cheap Samsung.",17,15,-2,32,46.875,53.125,"   monitor   sharp  clear    expect  unlike    reviewers  negative comments   able  get  running  k resolution  hz   fundamental issue     things like many others   issue  like one reviewer called  milky white hue   entire monitors image  ive tried every combination  cables calibration    retina macbook pro summer     nothing   can   get  monitor  produce  color black  anything close   acceptable  black    reason  cant give     stars even though  every  way    days using   seems   pretty darn good   pricemy next issue    spent  hour submitting  resubmitting  case   asus website   everything    make  entering  information difficult   ensure   human  didnt  nearly enough  actually accept  process  case    get    approximately  times   ton  issues along  way   error   submission    feedback   assume    never got  email   saying  case  received    done   many times   reason      refuse  sit   phone  hours  hours getting little   help like   reviewers  issues   im extremely technical   everything possible  save  monitor  needing  go back     color black  living  everything looking like    white film    unacceptable    dollar piece  equipment especially    dollar samsung wuxga monitor next    much better color    special enough  sit    deski really really wish   fix  issue   doesnt appear   driver related etcjust  frame    used dp    configurations monitors menus  using   mbp retina  k   hz    mbp retina   runs  x   went   mac display expert mode calibration process  managed  get  monitor   best image   manage    looking  another monitor  using   yielded semiacceptable results except   put  anything  black   major part   color palette       falls apart   become extremely disappointed  highly annoyed  every second    look   dark grey blacksthe image   attached   result  many hours  tweaking  calibrating   picture    poorly lit room   monitor  getting  credit   deserves   one   right   asus pbq   one   right   dollar  inch samsung  hardly  inputs  features running  x   can see   best image   derive    asus hardly passes  black  compared   cheap samsung

"2","So after reading all the pros and cons that Amazon reviewers had to say about this monitor, I decided to jump ship and buy it.1 week using it and here is my review:EXTERNAL LOOKSA- Bezel frame: Thin (~1.5cm from all sides) and with matte finish. Compared to my ASUS VG278H whose frame is a bit thicker but full reflective plastic.B- Monitor stand: Made of matte plastic, now I am guilt-free for placing the center speaker right under the monitor on its stand not fearing to scratch it.C- Adjustment: As you probably know, you can adjust the height and tilt of the monitor (i don't care about the 90 degree rotation really), you must know this feature of height & tilt adjustment is crucial for TN type monitors to give you the best ""sweet spot"" to get best picture possible.D- Function Keys: Many pro reviewers said ASUS should move the keys to the bottom instead of the weird behind the monitor new location. I agree with that. But I don't agree with the pro reviewers that this caused them to press the on/off multiple times while trying to adjust the monitor specs, this never happened with me. Lets face it, pro youtube reviewers review like 100 things a week, they go on fast and clumsy when testing so yes it does happen with them, but when you are the final owner and you adjust the monitor to your liking, this should not happen with you.USING THIS 4K BEASTA- TN Panel: Compared to my other ASUS VG278H (using at home) and ASUS VE278Q (using at work), this 4K monitor has excellent viewing angels like them, if not a tiny slightly hard-to-see better than them.B- Colors: side by side as I'm writing this review, comparing this 4K with the VG278H, the 4K has more vivid & crispier colors, however the VG278H is more brighter and handles the contrast/brightness better. Is this really affecting my view? No. Any effect on gaming or regular photo viewing? No. If they weren't side by side, you won't notice. I tried to adjust both monitors to give the exact same colors but after 15 minutes I gave up, I managed to get them very close to each other, but when you see the same background on both monitors you can tell there is slight difference between the colors, but not something like WOW that's TOO much. Does it bother me? No.C- Regular computer use (mainly browsing the Internet): I completely agree with what people said that the fonts are TOO SMALL in the 4K to the extent that they are unreadable. I have excellent eye sight (knock on wood) and I sit like 2-3 feet from the monitor, I can't read, period. So if you already own a 1080p (or 1440) monitor, DO NOT THROW IT AWAY, use it as an extended desktop monitor and open all regular windows over there. I use the 4K for viewing videos, photos and watching youtube. I have set Google Chrome to zoom its pages at +%200 so i can also watch youtube at 4K resolution (yes, apparently some youtube videos stream at 4K, never knew that!) But the catch is the Chrome tabs are SO FREAKING SMALL to read their titles! I can live with that, at least the pages content are easy to read like a regular 1080 monitor. All other Windows windows (like control panel, folder browsing, My Computer, other programs like MS Office, etc...) area dragged to be used in the 1080p monitor, then when I watch a movie or run a game, the computer will automatically use the 4K since it is the PRIMARY monitor. Even when viewing photos, it will open the photo viewer in the 4K. Basically speaking everything will open in the 4K by default, you only drag what you want to the 1080p and next time you open it, it will open there immediately.D- Windows Scaling: I tried using the Windows scaling stuff (I have Windows 7 Ultimate 64x) but NO NO, because 1- You have lost lots of real estate space on the 4K monitor and 2- It will also scale on the 1080p which looked horrible. You can't tell Windows to scale on one monitor and forget the other. So if you have a secondary 1080 or 1440 monitor, don't use scaling and apply the techniques I described in point C above.E- 60Hz refresh rate: My 1080p ASUS VG278H is a 120Hz monitors, many people told me you will regret going back to 60Hz. I had a theory before that I posted in a reply at one of the reviewers here in Amazon about this monitor, that the extra huge number of pixels is going to compensate me with the drop of the refresh rate. Let me tell you and it's up to you to believe me or not, YES IT DID. One simple test i did was to open a folder window, drag it to be split between the two monitors so now half of it is in the 4K @ 60Hz and the other is in the 1080p @ 120Hz, i started dragging the folder window up and down, it was smoother on the 4K! Whether you believe me or not it's up to you, but I am completely satisfied. Theoretically speaking, the 4K is almost the same physical size as the 1080 monitor (28"" & 27"" respectively) but packs double the amount of pixels at each axis, so when you move something across the 4K monitor, it is relatively moving slower than the 1080p thus compensates for the difference in Hz between them. Everything in the 4K monitor moves smoother (but slower area coverage for same mouse movement) than the 1080p.F- Gaming general experience on two monitors: I won't waste time saying how games will look better on the 4K, YES THEY DO. When you game, Windows will use your 4K for the game, the other monitor will stay open on Windows desktop displaying whatever was being displayed, but your mouse pointer won't be able to go there anymore unless you exit the game. So if you are downloading a torrent or performing some activity, you can keep an ""eye"" on it while playing a game in the 4K monitor.G- 4K Gaming horse power required and the 60Hz/fps limitation: As I mentioned in point E, I have not seen any difference that makes me regret gaming on 60Hz, it is not affecting the gaming experience at all and I have tested on both screens one at a time, in fact, it looks way better to game in the 4K. As for the horse power, let me tell you, 4K is not a walk-in-the-park for your computer, I have 2x SLI EVGA 780Ti Superclocked ACX cards, the twin were able to maintain a steady 60fps performance with less than AAA games or AAA games that are 2-3 years old like (Call of Duty Black Ops II, Counter Strike GO, Sim City), but on high end graphics demanding AAA games like (Watch Dogs, Assassin's Creed Black Flag) the fps averages around 45fps and i have seen it drop down to 15 when the screen gets too crowded for a second. By the way I'm talking here about full/ultra/super all-on in-game graphics settings. So to counter the low fps in these two games, I took an advice from one youtube review of this monitor which is to disable the AA in games because since you have higher PPI for the same surface area then AA is going to be smoother in games even if turned off, so I tried it and it wasn't that bad, this have increased my ""worst"" fps in those two games to 25 and the highest to 50fps. When any of those two games load first time, they stutter badly for the first minute or two while it is loading all the tiny graphic details like the vegetation and human faces, cars, ships (Assassin's Creed) all around your character, then the stuttering will be gone. So every time I run the game, I take my character for a 10 seconds walk around the city and drive one car till I see the stuttering has finished then enjoy a smooth game (until all hell breaks lose when 4 police cars are trying to ram my car that's when the game stutters a bit).FINAL THOUGHTSDo I regret spending $650 on this 4K? No. Games look superbly better, the 60Hz thing is NOT affecting gaming experience at all, period. But you MUST keep in mind you seriously need HUGE horsepower to play AAA games at full specs (minus the Anti Aliasing), otherwise if you have one 780Ti card or a lower 2-Way SLI GPUs, most likely you will need to lower game specification to get a playable game above 40-45fps. I ""assume"" if you have NVIDIA Titan it should be able to handle the 4K easily due to its 6Gb on board video memory, but that's a @2000+ card. Our personal photos are looking much better on the 4K, so sharp and beautiful and no longer we have to zoom in and out since almost each photo fits in the 4K frame without zooming, so you are viewing at original size on 4K, WOW. Even my wife who doesn't really care about gadgets and computers noticed that photos are much better on this 4K monitor. My only beef with this monitor that there is a tiny small grey-ish mouse-pointer-size (remember mouse pointer is twice as small in the 4K as it's in the 1080/1440) grey pixels that seem to be generating from way behind the monitor's front surface, as if it was a 3D effect, but since it is tucked at the bottom left corner (just above the Windows Start button) and when I game i never see it, I decided against sending the monitor back for replacement. I only see this tiny grey area when i have a plain white page like browsing the Internet.If you are thinking about this monitor, go get it, you won't regret it.EDIT 21/8/2014: Added more information, spelling and typo corrections and general formatting.EDIT 24/8/2014: I found a proper solution for tackling the very small font of the 4K when using the monitor for regular daily use (Above point #C in reviewing the monitor use). Due to the small fonts produced by the 4K, reading Chrome tabs and the URL bar was really too difficult to handle although i set the pages themselves to zoom %200 by default as mentioned above, however many windows were being opened in the 4K monitor since it was set as my primary monitor and I found my self more and more using the 1080 screen and wasting time dragging windows to it. So since I have changed all the resolution setup inside my games to play at 4K, I did a test and found that it really did NOT matter if the Windows 7 Desktop resolution was set to 1080p on the 4K monitor as the game will STILL launch at 4K res (3840 x 2160), so now my 4K screen is locked at 1080 res on Windows Desktop and I'm using it now properly, no more dragging windows so i can read! Another advantage now I can use those two-screens themed wallpapers which looks cool since the resolution match on both monitors! I have also put all icons on the 1080p monitor and kept the 4K desktop surface clean with only the taskbar in it!

"3","In reading these reviews, they range from ""OMG AWESOME!!!!"" to ""I've just sent back my 4th one..."".  I don't know the ratio of great ones vs ones people have to send back but mine is great.  Luckily for us, Amazon's return policy is great so if you get a lemon, it's not too big a deal to send it back and get a good one.  I know that's not something some should be having to do, but it's worth it to keep trying till you get a good one.Pros:-------- Very clear, crisp, detailed, sharp, vivid picture- I've tried low rez 120hz, I've tried triple screen, I'm back to this 2560x1440 at .233 dot pitch.  This is the  best to me.  For gaming, for reading text, it's all awesome.- After having tried 120hz and even triple screens at low 1080 rez (1920x1080 and 5760x1080), switching back to high rez, BF3 is amazingly clear and detailed again.  Not just the high rez, but the .233mm dot pitch is stunningly sharp to game on.  I'm convinced high rez is the best way to go.  Not 120hz, not triple screen.- The matte coating isn't aggressive or harsh- Stand does all the motions you'd want and is easy to put togetherCons:-------- Mine appears to be fine, no dead pixels, no backlight issues, no smudges behind the coating, so the panel itself is great, however the BACK portion of the plastic bezel that surrounds the screen appears to have nicks ands scratches on it.  Very minor quality control thing but it affects me none, affects the experience none.  Not too worried about it.UPDATE: 03/23/2013. Oh ;)  I just found out about this was, the Con that I was talking about.  It wasn't a bunch of scratches on the back part of the bezel.  It was actually a thin film of plastic that's supposed to be pealed off when I unboxed it.  My mistake.  The monitor is perfect.Note:  In the monitor settings.  Be sure to set some custom settings:- They say to put brightness to 37, however that was too dark for me.  I like 55- Contrast to 80- Splendid mode : User- Set your RGB gains to:  R to 47  G to 49  B to 45- Set Trace to 40Summary Update:  03/23/2013.  So been using the monitor for a few days and couldn't be happier.  No dead pixels, no backlight problems, stunning clarity.  Great monitor.  If you order this and happen to get one with a problem.  Don't get discouraged.  I know that sucks, but return it through Amazon and get another one again.  It will be worth it.  This is a great, detailed monitor with a vivid beautiful picture.  Played lots of BF3 as well and there's no ghosting/input lag issues at all.Another Update:  08/10/2013.  The moniter has been awesome except it began to have an electrical problem.  It started randomly cycling through it's graphic modes.  User, sRGB, Theater, Scenery, etc.  Rabidly cycling through modes and I couldn't do anything to stop it.  Menu buttons wouldn't respond so couldn't reset it. Left it unplugged for awhile but that didn't help.  I had it too long to return to Amazon, so I went through Asus's RMA process and that's why I wanted to give an update and give them props.....Asus paid for shipping to/from and replaced a board inside the monitor in about a week or less.  When they shipped it back, it was nicely packed well in packing bubble insulation and it works perfectly again.  Asus is a great brand, and their support is great as well.

"5","This monitor is absolutely amazing for the price.  I was initially very disappointed because my mouse seemed to have a delay as it moved across the screen despite the fact that I have a very powerful computer.  This was because even if you're using a DisplayPort connection, the monitor is set to use DP v1.1 by default.  As you may know DP v1.1 only allows for a 30Hz refresh rate.  If you have a video card capable of utilizing DP v1.2 you will need to make sure the monitor is set to use DP v1.2 in order to utilize the full 60Hz refresh rate.  Once properly set everything feels extremely smooth and there is no delay.Monitor Settings:Menu -> System Setup -> DisplayPort Stream -> DP 1.2Computer Settings (Windows 8.1):Right Click on Desktop -> Screen Resolution -> Advanced Settings -> List All Modes -> ""3840 by 2160, True Color (32 bit), 60 Hertz""",2,9,7,11,81.8181818181818,18.1818181818182,"   monitor  absolutely amazing   price    initially  disappointed   mouse seemed    delay   moved across  screen despite  fact      powerful computer     even  youre using  displayport connection  monitor  set  use dp v  default    may know dp v  allows   hz refresh rate      video card capable  utilizing dp v  will need  make sure  monitor  set  use dp v  order  utilize  full hz refresh rate   properly set everything feels extremely smooth     delaymonitor settingsmenu  system setup  displayport stream  dp computer settings windows right click  desktop  screen resolution  advanced settings  list  modes     true color  bit  hertz

"6","I'm posting this review particularly for someone who wants to know how this monitor compares to Apple's 27"" monitor or a 27"" iMac for editing photographs.So, first some qualification: I'm comparing my late 2009 iMac's monitor panel to this ASUS PB278Q. And, I'm making my comparison based on calibrating both of them using Coloreyes Display Pro calibration kit purchased within the last six months.My purpose for this monitor is to rotate it into portrait mode so that I can work on my vertical photographs in Photoshop, Lightroom, Capture One, etc, at the same display size that my 27"" iMac provides for horizontal photographs. (roughly 2/3 of my shots are vertical) So, it was important to me to get a close match in performance and behavior between them. And, happily, I feel I was able to do this.Leaving the ASUS in ""Standard"" view mode with no user adjustments and calibrating with the Coloreyes app and Spyder, I got a reasonable match, but noticed that the iMac color gradations were smoother, and not surprisingly, the ASUS looked a little sharper. I could have almost lived with this, but I decided to persevere.I won't bore you with how many approaches I took to resolving this difference, but my bottom line was that I got a decent comparison when I lowered the ASUS contrast down to 30 and then re-profiled it. Coloreyes' profile validation graph looked best at this setting and the monitors looked very close to each other -- close enough that I'm content to get back to work. ;-)This was actually a very good learning experience in that I got a better sense of what I would demand of a higher level (much more expensive) monitoring solution. But, there comes a point of diminishing returns and I'm going to settle for the performance that a 27"" iMac and this ASUS monitor provides for now.I haven't tried pairing two Apple 27"" displays, but I wonder if I tried pairing Apple's newer 27"" display with my 2009 iMac if I'd get any better matching. I wouldn't be surprised if I found a similar nuance of difference there as well.So, after calibration, with ASUS at Contrast: 30, three differences I see between the 2009 27"" iMac display and the ASUS PB278Q:(1) Slight difference in smoothness of very gradual color gradation in light and dark areas.(2) The iMac's blacks are blacker. But, when comparing actual photographs, this seems to be a non-issue.(3) Even after calibration, the two monitors do not display colors exactly the same. Here, the ASUS actually looks a little more ""right"" to me based on neutral grays and pure whites. The iMac looks just a tiny bit shifted to green. It IS going on 4 years old . . .Conclusions:Experience has taught me the value of calibrating your monitor. For someone who wants a good cost-effective solution, I recommend Coloreyes Display Pro. And, my conclusions are based on the assumption that you will calibrate your monitor.If you are trying to decide between Apple's $1000 display and this under-$600 alternative, you can safely save yourself $400-plus by going with this ASUS display. Use some of the $400 to get what you need to keep it in calibration and you'll be better off since you would need to calibrate the Apple display as well.If you are worried about pairing this display with your Apple 27"" display, I think you will likely be satisfied with how close you can get them. *OF COURSE* it won't be a *perfect* match. I'm not convinced that a new Apple would match perfectly either. At least in my case, it's a very workable pairing.My 27"" iMac does not have an anti-glare screen like the newer models. This ASUS does, and it's a welcome improvement.***I remember the first time I view my photographs on the iMac. I was previously using an EIZO ColorEdge CE210, which is a decent color calibrated monitor. The iMac just blew it away. And, once correctly calibrated, has served me very well. So, for me to say that I could be just as happy working with this ASUS as I have been with my iMac 27"" is saying something.Hope this is helpful to someone looking for this particular comparison like I was when trying to decide whether or not to buy the ASUS.If anything changes with use of the ASUS monitor, I will be sure to update my post.*** 12-11-2013 - OK, so here's an update. Everything is just fine with the ASUS monitor and I have very much enjoyed using it for Photoshop work. Today, I picked up an Apple ""Refurbished"" late-2012 design 27"" i7 iMac (barely any different from what they are selling today). So, now I can compare the look of the current 27"" iMac monitor to the ASUS instead of my almost 4-year-old one. Remarkably, the color balance is now much closer between the two. Just thought you might find that helpful. ***",4,37,33,41,90.2439024390244,9.75609756097561,"  im posting  review particularly  someone  wants  know   monitor compares  apples  monitor    imac  editing photographsso first  qualification im comparing  late  imacs monitor panel   asus pbq  im making  comparison based  calibrating    using coloreyes display pro calibration kit purchased within  last six monthsmy purpose   monitor   rotate   portrait mode    can work   vertical photographs  photoshop lightroom capture one etc    display size    imac provides  horizontal photographs roughly    shots  vertical    important    get  close match  performance  behavior    happily  feel   able   thisleaving  asus  standard view mode   user adjustments  calibrating   coloreyes app  spyder  got  reasonable match  noticed   imac color gradations  smoother   surprisingly  asus looked  little sharper    almost lived     decided  perseverei wont bore    many approaches  took  resolving  difference   bottom line    got  decent comparison   lowered  asus contrast      reprofiled  coloreyes profile validation graph looked best   setting   monitors looked  close     close enough  im content  get back  work   actually   good learning experience    got  better sense     demand   higher level much  expensive monitoring solution   comes  point  diminishing returns  im going  settle   performance    imac   asus monitor provides  nowi havent tried pairing two apple  displays   wonder   tried pairing apples newer  display    imac  id get  better matching  wouldnt  surprised   found  similar nuance  difference   wellso  calibration  asus  contrast  three differences  see     imac display   asus pbq slight difference  smoothness   gradual color gradation  light  dark areas  imacs blacks  blacker   comparing actual photographs  seems    nonissue even  calibration  two monitors   display colors exactly     asus actually looks  little  right   based  neutral grays  pure whites  imac looks just  tiny bit shifted  green   going   years old   conclusionsexperience  taught   value  calibrating  monitor  someone  wants  good costeffective solution  recommend coloreyes display pro   conclusions  based   assumption   will calibrate  monitorif   trying  decide  apples  display    alternative  can safely save  plus  going   asus display use      get   need  keep   calibration  youll  better  since   need  calibrate  apple display  wellif   worried  pairing  display   apple  display  think  will likely  satisfied   close  can get   course  wont   perfect match im  convinced   new apple  match perfectly either  least   case    workable pairingmy  imac     antiglare screen like  newer models  asus     welcome improvementi remember  first time  view  photographs   imac   previously using  eizo coloredge ce    decent color calibrated monitor  imac just blew  away   correctly calibrated  served   well     say     just  happy working   asus       imac   saying somethinghope   helpful  someone looking   particular comparison like    trying  decide whether    buy  asusif anything changes  use   asus monitor  will  sure  update  post   ok  heres  update everything  just fine   asus monitor     much enjoyed using   photoshop work today  picked   apple refurbished late design   imac barely  different     selling today  now  can compare  look   current  imac monitor   asus instead   almost yearold one remarkably  color balance  now much closer   two just thought  might find  helpful

"8","I want to start by saying ""Pixels aren't everything!"". Also, I would give the monitor a 3.5 - its better than a 3 but not good enough for a 4.More pixels does NOT always translate to a better monitor or even a sharper image. That being said, this is a good monitor. Its not perfect - not by a long means. I would have considered a IPS PB278Q a perfect monitor IF that came in 4k at this price (maybe someday in the future).I currently own both the 287 4k and the 278 monitors. My new dual monitor setup actually has 1 of each and here's why.1) Colors are MUCH better on the 278. I have displayed the same picture on both the screens adjusted to the screen's native resolution. I currently have the monitors setup side by side and asked 3 random people for their opinion. The difference becomes even more apparent when looking at websites on both monitors.2) Text is sharper on the 287, though the 278 maintains a pretty good level of sharpness when compared to the 4k 287 monitor! The 287 is still better but not my a huge margin as I would have been expected. Its not day and night like when moving from 1080p to Apple's Retina Display. This is because of a couple reasons, but primarily because the contrast in colors between the background and the font is better on the IPS panel - since colors are truer.3) Sometimes, pixels are needed. More pixels allows you to put more 'things' on screen without having to zoom out of applications to reduce size.4) There is significant horizontal and vertical color washing on the PB287. I initially wanted to use the monitor in portrait mode but I cannot - the color shift is pretty bad. Its not so visible on whites and blacks but when you put up a uniform yellow screen there is quite a bit of color shift.5) There is slightly more eye strain when using the 287. I think this is because the way the monitor handles white - white looks much better on the 278. So hours of web surfing or Word/Excel use, would be easier with the 278.At the end of the day, I wouldn't be able to choose between the 278 vs 287. They are both very good monitors - it depends on your use. If pixels are everything, than go for the 287 - but, if you care for a vivid, strain free experience - the 278 is the better monitor. I have one of each and will keep it this way until I can get a 4k IPS panel.And, as for the Samsung 28inch 4k, I wouldn't consider it when being compared to the 287. The 287 is hands down a better monitor. Its better with color and with features (VESA support, tilt, etc).Hope this helps.I have both my monitors hooked up to a late 2013 MacBook Pro.Edit:After using both monitors for a couple weeks I find myself surfing websites and watching video on the 278 and using the 287 while coding (black background with colored text). Coder's would appreciate the pixels but for general use stick with an IPS display. I don't play games on my computer, so I can't attest to that use.",3,27,24,30,90,10,"   want  start  saying pixels arent everything also   give  monitor     better      good enough    pixels   always translate   better monitor  even  sharper image   said    good monitor   perfect     long means    considered  ips pbq  perfect monitor   came  k   price maybe someday   futurei currently     k    monitors  new dual monitor setup actually      heres  colors  much better      displayed   picture    screens adjusted   screens native resolution  currently   monitors setup side  side  asked  random people   opinion  difference becomes even  apparent  looking  websites   monitors text  sharper    though   maintains  pretty good level  sharpness  compared   k  monitor    still better     huge margin      expected   day  night like  moving  p  apples retina display      couple reasons  primarily   contrast  colors   background   font  better   ips panel  since colors  truer sometimes pixels  needed  pixels allows   put  things  screen without   zoom   applications  reduce size   significant horizontal  vertical color washing   pb  initially wanted  use  monitor  portrait mode      color shift  pretty bad    visible  whites  blacks    put   uniform yellow screen   quite  bit  color shift   slightly  eye strain  using    think     way  monitor handles white  white looks much better     hours  web surfing  wordexcel use   easier     end   day  wouldnt  able  choose    vs      good monitors   depends   use  pixels  everything  go        care   vivid strain free experience      better monitor   one    will keep   way   can get  k ips paneland    samsung inch k  wouldnt consider    compared       hands   better monitor  better  color   features vesa support tilt etchope  helpsi    monitors hooked    late  macbook proeditafter using  monitors   couple weeks  find  surfing websites  watching video     using    coding black background  colored text coders  appreciate  pixels   general use stick   ips display  dont play games   computer   cant attest   use

"9","Originally I purchased 2 x ASUS PB279's which are both 1440p, after getting a taste for resolutions >1080p I decided to go for the real deal (true 4K) and get two of these. I purchased one from Warehouse Deals 4 Less (who admittedly didn't do a great job with the packaging - they taped just the product box and mailed it across the country) and the other I picked up from Fry's (come on Amazon - at the time of writing you have no stock of these).The monitors themselves are great, an issue I've had in the past when purchasing two identical monitors is inconsistency. I once returned and reordered the same monitor 4 times because I could not get the two displays to have the same color calibration (one inevitably had a slightly colored tint to it). This was not the case here, these beautiful IPS displays have very accurate colors and look identical when placed side by side (see attached images). In addition, I didn't have to do any calibration - they're virtually plug and play.Pros:- Accurate colors- Good viewing angles- 4K looks very sharp- Stand rotates is height adjustable- Needed little if any calibration out of the box- Low profile designCons:- Not currently carried by Amazon- CostAdditional tip:- These come preset to Displayport 1.1 which maxes out at a 30hz refresh rate for 4k (3840 x 2160), you need to go into the display's menu and change the Displayport stream to use 1.2 - this will allow you to up your refresh rate to 60hz.Other:- The buttons on the display are in the back as opposed to the bottom (like the PB278Q), it took me a while to get used to - I'm not sure if they provide the best UX but hiding the buttons looks nice.- The ""grey to grey"" response time of this display is 5ms, ~4ms higher than a non-IPS display such as the PB287Q.

"10","Wow ... I just replaced 4 older 2K monitors (Dell 2408s) with two of these ASUS 4K monitors and I'm loving it.  Several years ago I indulged myself in what I thought was an extravagance of 4 monitors.  What I found was that my productivity and comfort was significantly enhanced.  I've been programming since 1975 so I'm a reasonably good judge of these things.  My Dell 2408s ran hot though, and since I've moved to a place which enjoys 115 degree summers it's become an increasing burden. I've been holding off until I could get a 4K monitor (I was originally planning on getting a single 40"").  Finally one of my Dells fizzled and popped and I had to either replace it or upgrade the whole kit.As I still don't see a good 60 hz 40"" monitor I thought that I'd chance getting two of these ASUS 28"" monitors.  They're wonderful.  They run cold, eliminating my heating problem.  They're light, so my wall mounts no longer sag.  And they installed on Windows 8.1 without a problem.  I'm running them in side by side portrait mode, with one of them inverted so that the control buttons are all easily accessible on the outer edges.  I can easily see 150 lines of code now which makes it much easier to read and I have the second monitor for my output and search logs.  I increased my text size to 150%, which helped readability, selected the Extra Large mouse size, and enabled the Control button mouse finder -- 4320 x 3840 is after all a lot of screen and it's easy to lose the mouse.It's only been a couple of days so I can't comment on longer term reliability but my initial impression is that these monitors are about as good as it gets.",7,15,8,22,68.1818181818182,31.8181818181818,"  wow   just replaced  older k monitors dell s  two   asus k monitors  im loving   several years ago  indulged     thought   extravagance   monitors    found    productivity  comfort  significantly enhanced  ive  programming since   im  reasonably good judge   things   dell s ran hot though  since ive moved   place  enjoys  degree summers  become  increasing burden ive  holding     get  k monitor   originally planning  getting  single   finally one   dells fizzled  popped     either replace   upgrade  whole kitas  still dont see  good  hz  monitor  thought  id chance getting two   asus  monitors  theyre wonderful   run cold eliminating  heating problem  theyre light   wall mounts  longer sag    installed  windows  without  problem  im running   side  side portrait mode  one   inverted    control buttons   easily accessible   outer edges   can easily see  lines  code now  makes  much easier  read     second monitor   output  search logs   increased  text size    helped readability selected  extra large mouse size  enabled  control button mouse finder   x      lot  screen   easy  lose  mouseits    couple  days   cant comment  longer term reliability   initial impression    monitors    good   gets

"12","This is an ideal monitor for people who run both Windows and Mac.  I am a programmer so I bought a pair of these to have a lot of space for developing on either platform.

"13","I am a photographer and spent about 4 weeks researching monitors.  I went back and forth between the ASUS PB278Q and the Dell 2713H.  It was a hard decision but comparing the specs, the price point and reading other reviews I finally decided on the ASUS PB278Q.Here's Why:1.  The PLS panels produces better blacks than the IPS panels (which is very necessary for photo editing)2.  The price point at mid 500s saved me about 100 bucks that could be used towards a colormiter for calibration3.  There wasn't any real negative reviews about the monitor however I felt the ASUS didn't get the best reviews because it was a constant comparison to the better known name of Dell4.  The resolution was perfect and necessary for a 27"" monitor - 2560x14405.  It is 100%sRGB, which is the smaller gamut of colors compared to ProRGB and Adobe RGB however, sRGB is the internet standard and it still produce proper colored photographs.It is easy to get sucked into all the technical stuff and the numbers but what it comes down to is real world application.  Even with the most expensive, high end monitor with the wrong video card the monitor can be limited and vice versa with a great video card the specs of a mid-range monitor will exceed most people's expectation.  That is exactly what the ASUS did for me.  It exceeded my expectations on color delivery and accuracy straight out the box.  Coming from a 25"" 1080P color monitor where colors shifted depending on the angle of view the ASUS was like driving a BMW 750 vs A Toyota Camry.  It just did everything better.In fact I went back to old edited photos and corrected them because I had a more accurate perspective of color.  One of the most embarrassing things as a photographer is to have your photos shift color because your monitor showed you something different than expected on the web or in print.  I feel as if my editing skills have just gone up with the more accurate colors.You will read reviews that talks about light bleeding, flickering because of the LED back-lighting, etc.  I will tell you I have not noticed any of these issues.  Yes, on a total black screen in the corners you can see some light bleeding but in real world application it is not noticeable, not even one bit.  I noticed absolutely no flickering.  The monitor is a great monitor and I do not have any real complaints.  I am very happy with my purchase.Here are a list of my pros and cons (Please note my Cons are not really related to the ability of the monitor):Pros:*Color accuracy*Resolution (2560x1440 is phenomenal, it presents a much better presentation of images.  I can't go back to 1080p NOTE: for 2560x1440 resolution you must connect using DVI-D port or Display Port.  HDMI is not supported at this resolution unless your video card can support it.)*Size of monitor*Price Point*Wide Viewing Angle which eliminates color shifting depending on which angle you are looking from (No color shift from top/bottom or left/right)*PLS panels producing better blacks than IPS panels*100% sRGB color gamut*Easily rotated (must pull monitor out some to rotate to Horizontal position)*Ease of working in the dark or light*No reflections*The Semi-Glossy panel is not dull or patchy.  It's a nice mix of matte and glossy finish.*All connection cables are included in the box (Dual DVI, HDMI 1.4, Display Port, etc.)*Easy to assemble*3 Year warrantyCONS:*Doesn't come from manufacturer per-calibrated (but the price point makes it worth it and the colors are great out the box)*No USB ports on the monitor (a nicety but not a necessity)*Prefer side buttons instead of buttons at the bottom of the monitorAs you can see the pros out way the cons.  If you are in a delima of choosing a monitor and you want a great monitor without breaking the bank this is the monitor for you.  I believe you will be well pleased.  Other monitors of this size and resolution costs $100-$1000 more.  Jumping to a 30"" monitor more than double the cost versus a 27"" monitor but it is not a huge noticeable difference in size.  Also, for even better color accuracy you should calibrate the monitor with one of the better colormiters\calibration software on the market.I hope this review is helpful.Happy Shopping and again you will not go wrong with this monitor.",22,30,8,52,57.6923076923077,42.3076923076923,"     photographer  spent   weeks researching monitors   went back  forth   asus pbq   dell h     hard decision  comparing  specs  price point  reading  reviews  finally decided   asus pbqheres    pls panels produces better blacks   ips panels    necessary  photo editing   price point  mid s saved    bucks    used towards  colormiter  calibration   wasnt  real negative reviews   monitor however  felt  asus didnt get  best reviews     constant comparison   better known name  dell   resolution  perfect  necessary    monitor  x    srgb    smaller gamut  colors compared  prorgb  adobe rgb however srgb   internet standard   still produce proper colored photographsit  easy  get sucked    technical stuff   numbers    comes    real world application  even    expensive high end monitor   wrong video card  monitor can  limited  vice versa   great video card  specs   midrange monitor will exceed  peoples expectation    exactly   asus      exceeded  expectations  color delivery  accuracy straight   box  coming    p color monitor  colors shifted depending   angle  view  asus  like driving  bmw  vs  toyota camry   just  everything betterin fact  went back  old edited photos  corrected       accurate perspective  color  one    embarrassing things   photographer     photos shift color   monitor showed  something different  expected   web   print   feel    editing skills  just gone     accurate colorsyou will read reviews  talks  light bleeding flickering    led backlighting etc   will tell     noticed    issues  yes   total black screen   corners  can see  light bleeding   real world application    noticeable  even one bit   noticed absolutely  flickering   monitor   great monitor       real complaints     happy   purchasehere   list   pros  cons please note  cons   really related   ability   monitorproscolor accuracyresolution x  phenomenal  presents  much better presentation  images   cant go back  p note  x resolution  must connect using dvid port  display port  hdmi   supported   resolution unless  video card can support itsize  monitorprice pointwide viewing angle  eliminates color shifting depending   angle   looking   color shift  topbottom  leftrightpls panels producing better blacks  ips panels srgb color gamuteasily rotated must pull monitor    rotate  horizontal positionease  working   dark  lightno reflectionsthe semiglossy panel   dull  patchy    nice mix  matte  glossy finishall connection cables  included   box dual dvi hdmi  display port etceasy  assemble year warrantyconsdoesnt come  manufacturer percalibrated   price point makes  worth    colors  great   boxno usb ports   monitor  nicety    necessityprefer side buttons instead  buttons   bottom   monitoras  can see  pros  way  cons       delima  choosing  monitor   want  great monitor without breaking  bank    monitor     believe  will  well pleased   monitors   size  resolution costs    jumping    monitor   double  cost versus   monitor      huge noticeable difference  size  also  even better color accuracy   calibrate  monitor  one   better colormiterscalibration software   marketi hope  review  helpfulhappy shopping    will  go wrong   monitor

"14","First of all I wanted four things in a monitor:1.  IPS Screen.  23"" or 24""2.  HDMI,DVI,DisplayPort and VGA inputs.3.  USB inputs (at least two).4.  Sturdy Mount with Height,tilt and swivel adjustments.My budget was under $250 and, as I found out, that would be a challenge with all of the features I wanted.After looking at Dell, HP, Viewsonic and two other brands the ASUS was the only on that met all of the criteria.The PB238Q is a new model for ASUS.  It first shipped in August 2012 and there were very few reviews.  I went ahead a took a chance and couldn't be happier.PROS:1.  Beautiful colors and brilliance.  (I have an DEll XPS 8500 with an i7, 24 gigs of ram and a Sapphire HD-7970 graphics card so the system is fairly fast.)IPS screens really do make a difference.  I've had TN's and the difference is remarkable. True wide angle viewing.  You can stand almost behind the screen and the colors and images do not blur or ghost. No lost pixels or ghosting.2.  Every input I wanted.  I'm using HDMI but the DVI worked just as well.  The monitor has two speakers (albeit, not the highest quality) and with HDMI audio is enabled to the monitor.  I use my own speaker system but in a pinch the onboard monitor speakers are OK.3.  A four input USB hub on the monitor.  Two on the left side and two in the input section.  Great for plugging in your webcam, etc4.  Great mount.  Height, tilt and swivel adjustments.  Very sturdy.CONS:No major cons.  Two minor cons:1.  Onboard speakers are somewhat weak but what can you expect with a monitor.2.  Instructions are a challenge to read.  All of the info is there but they are on a large paper with about ten other languages.  Not a biggie.All in all for the price, I don't think you can get a better monitor.

"15","In 2015, 4K is all the rage. There are plenty of displays coming in at a similar price or even less than the PB278Q! Why would I choose this one?I am using this monitor for multiple purposes, and I'm guessing that you can relate to one of them.First off - I have this monitor connected to both a PC gaming rig and a Macbook Pro Retina, using both daily.// Graphics/coding/general use (Macbook Pro Retina connected via HDMI):- The screen real estate is great. Of course, a 4k monitor would be better, but 1440p is a great compromise between 4k and 1080p.- Colors look great. I don't need a perfectly calibrated monitor, but I wanted something better than a TN panel.I am using the sRGB preset, good enough for me! There are calibrated color profiles and monitor presets floating around the net, but having the brightness so low is painful.- The built-in speakers are boomy sounding when listening to music, but work darn good for watching videos.They don't distort, and get plenty loud! My only gripe is that volume can't be directly controlled through the OS (I think this is a HDMI issue).- OS X looks fine, no scaling for me.Even using a 'retina' display, the pixel density looks great (sitting 2.5ft away)-------------// Gaming/more general use (PC connected through DVI):So before this monitor, I have been using the Asus VG248QE 144hz monitor. It's 1080p, TN panel, meant for gaming.Games LOOK great. Seriously, the monitor is beautiful. When I hoped in to some CS:GO, it almost looked like I had SweetFX on! The washed out colors of the TN panel vs the rich colors of the PLS panel are no comparison.But do games FEEL great? Nope. Not if you've been spoiled by 144hz, 1ms glory. Will I get used to it? I don't know. I have the 144hz sitting in a box, tempted to set it up again for FPS games.This is not a gaming monitor. It is a great monitor, which can be used for gaming. My 780Ti holds 60fps in most games I've tried with my old settings.- Games look great as I explained above- 60hz is painful. Tried overclocking it > got to 90hz > tested for frame skipping > disgustingly bad > repeat -10hz > same results.- Windows looks fine, text isn't too tiny. Again, no scaling.------------I love this monitor, but it isn't without it's flaws.- This IS light bleed. I've attached a photo of it, but I assure you with 100% honesty that it is NOT noticeable and looks much worse in the photo.At first, I couldn't even tell if this was light bleed or not. Looks more like color shift from looking at a weird angle. It's fine. I was worried about it before I bought the monitor as well.- Menu is kinda weird. It' okay, but could be much better (steal LG's joystick, Asus).The only thing preventing me from 5 stars is the light bleed. It's not a big deal, but this is a decently priced monitor.Overall - great monitor. Enough real estate to spread out, not enough pixel to make your PC sweat and struggle while gaming.Sorry about the long review, but when I'm wanting a new gadget, I love read them!Oh also, to the person giving ONE STAR because the ""ports in the back are horribly designed and inaccessible"" -- I've used every input type on this monitor and fit every cable perfectly fine.",20,34,14,54,62.962962962963,37.037037037037,"    k    rage   plenty  displays coming    similar price  even less   pbq    choose  onei  using  monitor  multiple purposes  im guessing   can relate  one  themfirst      monitor connected    pc gaming rig   macbook pro retina using  daily graphicscodinggeneral use macbook pro retina connected via hdmi  screen real estate  great  course  k monitor   better  p   great compromise  k  p colors look great  dont need  perfectly calibrated monitor   wanted something better   tn paneli  using  srgb preset good enough     calibrated color profiles  monitor presets floating around  net    brightness  low  painful  builtin speakers  boomy sounding  listening  music  work darn good  watching videosthey dont distort  get plenty loud   gripe   volume cant  directly controlled   os  think    hdmi issue os x looks fine  scaling  meeven using  retina display  pixel density looks great sitting ft away gamingmore general use pc connected  dviso   monitor    using  asus vgqe hz monitor  p tn panel meant  gaminggames look great seriously  monitor  beautiful   hoped    csgo  almost looked like   sweetfx   washed  colors   tn panel vs  rich colors   pls panel   comparisonbut  games feel great nope   youve  spoiled  hz ms glory will  get used    dont know    hz sitting   box tempted  set     fps gamesthis    gaming monitor    great monitor  can  used  gaming  ti holds fps   games ive tried   old settings games look great   explained  hz  painful tried overclocking   got  hz  tested  frame skipping  disgustingly bad  repeat hz   results windows looks fine text isnt  tiny   scalingi love  monitor   isnt without  flaws   light bleed ive attached  photo     assure    honesty     noticeable  looks much worse   photoat first  couldnt even tell    light bleed   looks  like color shift  looking   weird angle  fine   worried     bought  monitor  well menu  kinda weird  okay    much better steal lgs joystick asusthe  thing preventing    stars   light bleed    big deal     decently priced monitoroverall  great monitor enough real estate  spread   enough pixel  make  pc sweat  struggle  gamingsorry   long review   im wanting  new gadget  love read themoh also   person giving one star   ports   back  horribly designed  inaccessible  ive used every input type   monitor  fit every cable perfectly fine

"16","I recently purchased a Mac Mini 2.6 GHz Quad-Core Intel core i7 and this 27 ASUS PB278Q WQHD LED-lit PLS Professional Graphics Monitor.  The monitor came with several connecting cables, VGA-VGA, DVI-DVI, HDMI-HDMI, DisplayPort to DisplayPort.  The Mac mini has an HDMI and a mini DislpayPort connection.  I tried the HDMI, but of course the best resolution I could get was 1080.  I needed an adapter cable to connect the Mac mini to the ASUS monitor.  I tried three adapter cables.  Neither the Accell B143B-003J UltraAV Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort 1.2 Cable, the StarTech M/M MDP2DPMM6 Mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort Adapter Cable, nor the Monoprice 5106 Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter gave me the full 2560 X 1440 resolution of the monitor or fill the entire display of the monitor.  I didnt originally purchase the Apple Mini MB571Z/A DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter based on its price.  I thought that the other adapter cables would work.  I went ahead and ordered the Apple adapter cable.  When it arrived, I connected it to the Mac mini and ASUS monitor.  When I powered the Mac and monitor back up, I immediately had full 2560 X1440 resolution and full screen display.  I have been using the monitor with the Mac mini and Apple adapter cable now for six weeks and have had no issues.  I have had no problems with the monitor waking from sleep mode like I have read in other reviews using other adapter cables to connect a Mac mini and ASUS monitor.  This is correct adapter for my Mac mini configuration and monitor.  I would not recommend trying to make the other adapter cables work.  This is a great monitor.

"18","I had this monitor out of the box and back into it, ready to be returned, in the span of about two hours. After setting it up, the backlight bleed in all four corners and across the entire bottom edge of the panel was so offensive it warped white into yellow and black into off-green. I understand that IPS and PLS panels are prone to edge bleeding and ""IPS glow"", especially in 27+ inch displays, but this specific instance far exceeds what can be considered acceptable. I'm willing to give this monitor another shot and have another one in the mail, but until then the 1-star review will stick.What's the point of a monitor with amazing color reproduction when the backlight completely devastates those colors on 1/3 of the screen?

"19","Coming from dual 27"" 1080p Monitors, I will say this, once you go super narrow slim bezels, you'd never want to go back. This monitor is gorgeous and absolutely amazing in every way. Unless you are a competitive First-Person-Shooting gamer, otherwise this monitor is the best purchase I have ever made for casual gaming and professional use. 1080p vs 1440p, yea, you will see the difference but not as much as 4Ks. I would rather use one of these monitor than a triple setup of 27"" 1080p screens. Looking forward to the 4K version of this exact build style which is the PA328Q, the Perfect Monitor for non-hardcore gamers and professionals. This PB328Q is a VA panel while the PA328Q is the true IPS version at double of the cost unfortunately(currently sold on amazon.uk). I've researched plenty and compared most of the 32"" 1440p Monitors. This monitor came out late after the almost same spec version of BenQ BL3200PT, Samsung S32D850T, and Acer B326HUL. Take a look at this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASMKZDYVaVE video of those 3 in comparison. If you are in search of a Great 1440p monitor but do not want to spend so much to power 4Ks, get this monitor. You will not regret this purchase even though the price is a bit high. In my opinion, if this monitor was around $400-$500, it would be sold out within weeks or even days. Overall it is a very very good monitor 8.5/10. The PA328Q would be 9.5/10.

"20","Not usually one to write reviews, but at the time of purchase a few days ago, information on this monitor was scarce.  So thought it might be helpful to folks to share a few observations.For comparison, my other displays are the Dell 2408WFP and BenQ 241W.  The monitor is generally used for professional PC work only, so no comment on HDMI, gaming lag, etc at present.So far, mostly just great news.  Love the relatively thin and simple bezel.  Not only is the minimal approach more professional looking, it also saves space around the monitor on the desk.- Packing was very good, no issues with the monitor.  Arrived double-boxed.  No dead pixels to my eye.- Out of the box, the monitor had some odd sharpness feature.  Why this is default on, who knows.  But it was easy to disable with the joystick menu selector.  Seems they call it ""VividPixel"".  Sharpness would have been a little more simpler term to figure out, but glad someone in Asus marketing is feeling better.  Set to ""0"" now, and looks normal.- Menus are easy to navigate.  Toned down the slight blue hue (to my eye) by setting the Blue Filter to level 1.  Set Gamma to 2.2, Brightness to 45.  Otherwise, pretty nice color out of the box.  Will calibrate with Spyder4 later.- Swivel up/down is smooth and solid.  Side to side rotate is good and firm.  A bonus would have been to allow the monitor to rotate 360 on the stand, but it stops about 1/3rd or so.  Might take the stand apart one day to tweak this.- No buzzing, no dead pixels, good accurate color and contrast thus far.  Really like the thin/minimal bezel compared to by 24"" BenQ and Dell.- The ports are USB3, easily side accessible.  I like how Dell places some USB ports underneath to minimize cord clutter, but the side connections will be fine for occasional use.- The built in speakers are acceptable, but not particularly loud (HP Elitebook is even louder volume).  Nice with Displayport to have the audio built in as an option though.  Most certainly not audiophile quality, but better than nothing.- Size-wise - very happy to have selected 32"" instead of 34"".  At 32"", my aging eyes are just able to survive with 2650x1440 resolution at ~3ft viewing distance, normal windows 7 font size.  Very comparable font size (equivalent?) to the 24"" monitors at 1920x1200, just more (lots more?) real-estate to multitask, edit documents, spreadsheets, etc.  The 34"" wider format would have resulted in smaller font sizes due to relative lack of vertical height. Very glad Asus and BenQ provided product offerings at this potentially more specialized resolution format from a working professional standpoint.  Games/Entertainment would be a different story, but for PC work, 32"" is great.Box mentions 3yr warranty which hopefully will not be needed.Update: 16 Oct 2015 -Monitor working great as the daily driver.  12h+ use per day, low heat use, no power saving no issues with Windows, screen still looks as good as day one. No buzzing or weird sounds. Luxury screen real-estate with apps.  A keeper for sure.  Yet to connect any gaming consoles, so no comment regarding ghosting or refresh.

"22","- - - - - - - - UPDATE - - - - - - - -I have been told by other users that this screen does not have a VA panel. Other users say it has (see: [...]). Perhaps Amazon is smooshing all the comments for different models of screens together and the user questions are for *all* models in this range. Very annoying if this is the case. So after using this monitor for a few days, I noticed a couple of problems. 1) It ran hot, 2) there was light bleed on the edges during the night using it in a darker mode. I still think this is a great WQHD screen for programmers for around the $300 mark, but I've finally settled on  the ASUS PB278Q 27"", which is an IPS panel without the corona on bright-dark edges that I got from the full-gamut screens: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009C3M7H0 - - - - - - - - OLD - POST - - - - - - - -After trying 5 different screens from Full-HD (1920x1080) through 4K (3840x2160), from TN panels, to VA panels, to IPS panels; I finally found what I think is the ideal screen for programmers! My requirements for a good programming monitor are, in order: 1) contrast, 2) light issues (glare, leak, bleed, milk, etc), 3) resolution, 4) color gamut, 5) refresh rate. Firstly contrast: a programmer needs good contrast ratios to get high quality readable text in a light room, and the same for ""night-mode"", where the lights are out and the screen is dimmed. Secondly light issues: I find that IPS panels leak light around the edges of high-contrast pixels, if you view a dark color next to a light color, you see a small rainbow where the pixels meet, which is incredibly frustrating while trying to program. I like to use sharp anti-aliased fonts when I program, so light-leak around high-contrast pixels is particularly noticeable. Light bleed on edges of IPS and low-quality TN panels are also very annoying. Thirdly, resolution: 4k is too high for comfortable reading of non-anti-aliased fonts around the 15px per font size, which is about the average size a font looks good non-antialiased (to me), typically I use Nerd Fonts, Sauce Code Pro Extra Light and ProggyCleanTTSZ (slashed zeros). I can see why 4K is possibly great to games, photo editing, CAD and the like, but for programming, I don't get why you would want a resolution that high, and I think that quality of the color and contrast options fall far behind the resolution with the current 4k technology. Fourthly, color gamut: I don't need 100% Adobe RGB or 100% sRGB  color space for 80% of what I work on, and frankly, a full color gamut screen makes most things fugly, because most things are not designed on 100% color space screens; however if you are editing photos of a sunset, or spending a lot of time getting screen color to match print, then yes, 100% Adobe color space is your friend; also the high gamut screens I tried, did not work with video due to refresh rate issues, the video played back without the full color gamut; which could be a real deal-braker if you're editing video. Fifthly, refresh rate: the higher the rate, the less eye fatigue; this monitor has 75hz, which is... OK but if the choice is that or having a 144hz refresh rate with poor contrast and light bleed around high-contrast pixels, then 75hz will do. Things that don't matter: viewing angle, because I'm sitting right in front of the screen; high color gamut, because I'm editing photos. All in all the ASUS PB277Q has the high-contrast VA panel which is crisp on fonts, the colors a great for the price. Bad point, the screen is too light, I have to weigh mine down with rocks to stop it from floating away.",20,22,2,42,52.3809523809524,47.6190476190476,"          update           told   users   screen     va panel  users say   see  perhaps amazon  smooshing   comments  different models  screens together   user questions    models   range  annoying     case   using  monitor    days  noticed  couple  problems   ran hot    light bleed   edges   night using    darker mode  still think    great wqhd screen  programmers  around   mark  ive finally settled    asus pbq     ips panel without  corona  brightdark edges   got   fullgamut screens httpswwwamazoncomgpproductbcmh         old  post         trying  different screens  fullhd x  k x  tn panels  va panels  ips panels  finally found   think   ideal screen  programmers  requirements   good programming monitor   order  contrast  light issues glare leak bleed milk etc  resolution  color gamut  refresh rate firstly contrast  programmer needs good contrast ratios  get high quality readable text   light room     nightmode   lights     screen  dimmed secondly light issues  find  ips panels leak light around  edges  highcontrast pixels   view  dark color next   light color  see  small rainbow   pixels meet   incredibly frustrating  trying  program  like  use sharp antialiased fonts   program  lightleak around highcontrast pixels  particularly noticeable light bleed  edges  ips  lowquality tn panels  also  annoying thirdly resolution k   high  comfortable reading  nonantialiased fonts around  px per font size     average size  font looks good nonantialiased   typically  use nerd fonts sauce code pro extra light  proggycleanttsz slashed zeros  can see  k  possibly great  games photo editing cad   like   programming  dont get    want  resolution  high   think  quality   color  contrast options fall far behind  resolution   current k technology fourthly color gamut  dont need  adobe rgb   srgb  color space      work   frankly  full color gamut screen makes  things fugly   things   designed   color space screens however    editing photos   sunset  spending  lot  time getting screen color  match print  yes  adobe color space   friend also  high gamut screens  tried   work  video due  refresh rate issues  video played back without  full color gamut     real dealbraker  youre editing video fifthly refresh rate  higher  rate  less eye fatigue  monitor  hz   ok    choice      hz refresh rate  poor contrast  light bleed around highcontrast pixels  hz will  things  dont matter viewing angle  im sitting right  front   screen high color gamut  im editing photos     asus pbq   highcontrast va panel   crisp  fonts  colors  great   price bad point  screen   light    weigh mine   rocks  stop   floating away

"23","I have had 4 exchanges so far and they all had various distracting flaws like: dead pixels, severe backlight bleeding, poor uniformity that one side looked warmer, dust behind the AG, Dim backlight, and the 2nd replacement was completely defunct. The 4th and the last one was almost perfect (excellent uniformity, bright and minimum BLB), Almost! except one dead pixel on the lower left side of the screen, arrgg... But I've decided to just put up with it since another replacement might be worse with such p**s poor quality control. Honestly, I've never had any issues with Dell and HP IPS or Samsung screens, all were perfect out of the box and I have not replaced any of them.It is truly a shame, because the PB278Q is otherwise an excellent screen. First of all I don't notice the PWM even with brightness at 25. The Contrast and colors are deep. Colors are slightly more vivid than sRGB, but no where near as pronounced as on a Wide-Gamut panel, this makes movies and games look absolutely fantastic, especially after you calibrate it. motion blur is minimal, its pretty fast for a PLS/IPS panel but may not be the best for competitive fps. If you have a Nvidia card get the program Nvidia Inspector, limit your framerate to 58 or 59 to reduce mouse input lag if you use vsync, it helps a lot in fast games and it may also fix the micro-stuttering in games like Skyrim. The Anti-Glare coating is superb, that dirty and fuzzy look you see on many IPS AG coatings is not a concern here and you also won't see your reflection as on a glossy screen, its almost the best of both worlds.If it isn't for all the manufacturing issues I would totally give PB278Q 5 stars and I wouldn't mind paying $100 more if it means better QC. Still, this monitor will be my main screen for now, replacing my Dell U3011.",21,18,-3,39,46.1538461538462,53.8461538461538,"      exchanges  far     various distracting flaws like dead pixels severe backlight bleeding poor uniformity  one side looked warmer dust behind  ag dim backlight   nd replacement  completely defunct  th   last one  almost perfect excellent uniformity bright  minimum blb almost except one dead pixel   lower left side   screen arrgg  ive decided  just put    since another replacement might  worse   ps poor quality control honestly ive never   issues  dell  hp ips  samsung screens   perfect    box     replaced   themit  truly  shame   pbq  otherwise  excellent screen first    dont notice  pwm even  brightness    contrast  colors  deep colors  slightly  vivid  srgb    near  pronounced    widegamut panel  makes movies  games look absolutely fantastic especially   calibrate  motion blur  minimal  pretty fast   plsips panel  may    best  competitive fps     nvidia card get  program nvidia inspector limit  framerate      reduce mouse input lag   use vsync  helps  lot  fast games   may also fix  microstuttering  games like skyrim  antiglare coating  superb  dirty  fuzzy look  see  many ips ag coatings    concern    also wont see  reflection    glossy screen  almost  best   worldsif  isnt    manufacturing issues   totally give pbq  stars   wouldnt mind paying     means better qc still  monitor will   main screen  now replacing  dell u

"24","I had a dual monitor setup, but reconfigured my workspace; it only had room for one monitor.  I spent a lot of time researching various monitor brands and their specifications. My desktop is a Mac Mini, and although the Apple Thunderbolt 27"" display is the obvious choice, and I loved its 2560 x 1440 resolution, reviews and price steered me away. My search led me to the ASUS PB27Q and boy am I glad it did.This display is stunning. Gorgeous colors, very easy on the eyes--I can work all day in front of this at 2560 x 1440, no dead pixels, calibrated perfect (for me) right out of the box.

"25","I researched for a couple of months before buying this monitor. It is a very good monitor for its price, it seems that it does not suffer from the backlight bleed issues that the PA238Q model, I don't have the PA so I can't confirm. But from what I read and seen in reviews and forums, this monitor has a much more uniform screen. It is a very new model so haven't seen any in-depth review on it in reputable sites like PRAD, but if you scavenge the internet you will find a site from China that did a pretty extensive review on it, confirming its Delta E less than 5 and 98% sRGB. Comparing the two monitors the specs seem pretty much the same. I would say that the only difference is the fact that the PA series comes calibrated from the factory and has probably more image fine tuning possibilities on the hardware itself. But I don't think that it matters much when calibration needs to be maintained and redone. What I did is I bought the PB238Q and from what I saved from the PA238Q bought a color calibrator.(UPDATE: Dec 3rd 2012) I Calibrated the monitor with Spyder4Pro and the analyses says its 98% sRGB , so as I suspected it is a very similar model to the PA238Q without the factory calibration and better uniform screen without the backlight bleed.",4,7,3,11,63.6363636363636,36.3636363636364,"   researched   couple  months  buying  monitor     good monitor   price  seems     suffer   backlight bleed issues   paq model  dont   pa   cant confirm     read  seen  reviews  forums  monitor   much  uniform screen     new model  havent seen  indepth review    reputable sites like prad    scavenge  internet  will find  site  china    pretty extensive review   confirming  delta e less     srgb comparing  two monitors  specs seem pretty much     say    difference   fact   pa series comes calibrated   factory   probably  image fine tuning possibilities   hardware    dont think   matters much  calibration needs   maintained  redone      bought  pbq     saved   paq bought  color calibratorupdate dec rd   calibrated  monitor  spyderpro   analyses says   srgb     suspected     similar model   paq without  factory calibration  better uniform screen without  backlight bleed

"26","This is one of several monitors that use an AU Optronics AMVA panel with excellent ~2000:1 contrast ratio. 92 pixels/inch means that you can see individual pixels (i.e. this is not a retina display). If you have excellent vision and a modern OS and mostly use new applications that deal properly with high-resolution displays, this may not be the display for you. For those of us with less-than-perfect vision, older OSes and applications that don't properly scale windows, graphics and fonts, this display gives a lot of usable (legible) real estate. It also uses only about 25W when set to a reasonable brightness level. Colors and viewing angles are excellent.So why only 2 stars? Because Asus's quality control for this monitor is abysmal. Out of 6 of these monitors that I tried, ALL had multiple dead pixels, and 1 was completely unusable with a garbled 1.5"" horizontal stripe across the bottom of the screen. The best monitor had ""only"" 2 dead pixels and I considered keeping that one. But ultimately I decided not to settle for a second-rate screen at the rather premium price of the PB328Q. Given that I don't know if the quality control problems stem from Asus or from AU Optronics I decided to order a refurbished BenQ BL3200PT directly from BenQ. Even if it was no better than the Asus, at least it cost significantly less. As it turned out the BL3200PT that BenQ sent me has a pixel-perfect screen. If I ordered 6 BL3200PTs, how many would have perfect screens? I don't know. But like every other monitor I've ever bought aside from the PB328Q, I don't need to run that experiment. Thank goodness!Bottom line: I highly recommend that if the PB328Q appeals to you, that you choose the BenQ BL3200PT instead. Amazon seems to stock them only sporadically. When Amazon has them, their price is about the same as this one.Some other choices that use the same 32"" AU Optronics AMVA panel:Acer B326HUL: uses strong overdrive that can't be turned off -> reverse ghostingSamsung S32D850T aka LS32D85KTSR/ZA: uses PWM at lower brightness levels -> flickerHP N9C43AA: PWM unknown?; large speakersHP G8Z02AA: appears discontinued, but still available; uses PWM dimming -> flicker; large speakersPhilips BDM3270QP: doesn't seem to be available in USAOC Q3277PQU: doesn't seem to be available in USQnix QX320QHD: ships from S Korea; brightness control changes digital white level instead of backlight -> much reduced contrast ratio, no power savings at lower brightness; no overdrive -> poor response timeAlthough this review is about the monitor, not Amazon, I'd be remiss if I didn't praise Amazon's excellent customer service throughout my ordeal with multiple PB328Qs. They cross-shipped replacement monitors to me, and covered return shipping for defective monitors. In fact Amazon has been so good to me that I feel somewhat guilty for causing them to lose money trying to sell me a PB328Q. I'm assuaging my guilt by posting this review to warn others away from this monitor, by suggesting to Amazon that they simply stop selling the PB328Q, and by continuing to buy (and not return) many other items from Amazon.",14,21,7,35,60,40,"    one  several monitors  use  au optronics amva panel  excellent  contrast ratio  pixelsinch means   can see individual pixels ie     retina display    excellent vision   modern os  mostly use new applications  deal properly  highresolution displays  may    display      us  lessthanperfect vision older oses  applications  dont properly scale windows graphics  fonts  display gives  lot  usable legible real estate  also uses   w  set   reasonable brightness level colors  viewing angles  excellentso    stars  asuss quality control   monitor  abysmal      monitors   tried   multiple dead pixels    completely unusable   garbled  horizontal stripe across  bottom   screen  best monitor    dead pixels   considered keeping  one  ultimately  decided   settle   secondrate screen   rather premium price   pbq given   dont know   quality control problems stem  asus   au optronics  decided  order  refurbished benq blpt directly  benq even     better   asus  least  cost significantly less   turned   blpt  benq sent    pixelperfect screen   ordered  blpts  many   perfect screens  dont know  like every  monitor ive ever bought aside   pbq  dont need  run  experiment thank goodnessbottom line  highly recommend    pbq appeals     choose  benq blpt instead amazon seems  stock   sporadically  amazon    price       onesome  choices  use    au optronics amva panelacer bhul uses strong overdrive  cant  turned   reverse ghostingsamsung sdt aka lsdktsrza uses pwm  lower brightness levels  flickerhp ncaa pwm unknown large speakershp gzaa appears discontinued  still available uses pwm dimming  flicker large speakersphilips bdmqp doesnt seem   available  usaoc qpqu doesnt seem   available  usqnix qxqhd ships  s korea brightness control changes digital white level instead  backlight  much reduced contrast ratio  power savings  lower brightness  overdrive  poor response timealthough  review    monitor  amazon id  remiss   didnt praise amazons excellent customer service throughout  ordeal  multiple pbqs  crossshipped replacement monitors    covered return shipping  defective monitors  fact amazon    good     feel somewhat guilty  causing   lose money trying  sell   pbq im assuaging  guilt  posting  review  warn others away   monitor  suggesting  amazon   simply stop selling  pbq   continuing  buy   return many  items  amazon

"30","Unless you're a professional gamer, competing at the highest level, you really don't need a response time of 1ms on your gaming monitor. In other words, you really don't need a TN panel often found in BenQ monitors (not all their models but definitely their most popular). Don't get me wrong, BenQ makes phenomenal monitors, but if you're like me and the picture quality/color matters, I recommend purchasing an IPS monitor. This is a newer technology which provides better color and quality. The knock on IPS monitors is that getting a response time lower than 5ms is very difficult. Like I mentioned above, unless you're a professional gamer, it's very likely you wont even notice the difference. I do YouTube and pretty competitive gaming and I could not notice a difference between a 1ms BenQ and 6ms Acer playing a flinch reaction game (COD). Now, if we're talking about a 55"" flat screen TV compared to a 27"" monitor, you'll definitely notice the difference in the response time because the large TV will likely have a response time closer to 45ms. Believe me when I tell you, you will absolutely notice the difference between a quality IPS compared to a quality TN monitor, the TN panel's color will look washed out 10/10 times. Of course, resolution plays a factor here but when we're talking about console gaming (which I am), 1080p 60fps is the max you're going to get at the time of this review.Now that we have that out of the way, here's my review for the actual monitor. Let's be clear, this is a PREMIUM monitor. A few years ago when this monitor released, it cost about $700 (yes, this monitor is a few years old). $700 for a gaming monitor or second display is a lot of money, no question about it. Now that this monitor is a few years old and Asus has newer models (for much more money), this monitor is a steal at $400.Asus monitors, at least in my experience, are on the thicker side as far as physical dimensions. It's not because it's older technology as Asus still makes monitors that are thicker. That being said, this is a thicker monitor so keep that in mind before you purchase it. Not thick to the point its annoying or a deal breaker, but it isn't as thin as say, some Acer models that are on the market. And that's perhaps the end of the negative part of this review.I'm reviewing this monitor from a gaming AND second monitor perspective - I use this monitor for both. Let's talk about the most important part, the picture. This monitor looks GOOD. The picture is very clear and crisp, the colors pop and it's a really enjoyable visual experience. It's going to be a huge upgrade to just about all TN panels and entry level IPS monitors. I truly enjoy a nice picture and am willing to sacrifice a little response time, this monitor is well worth it, I promise you. If picture quality/color is important to you, then stop reading and add this monitor to your cart; you wont regret it. After all, that really is the most important part when it comes to a monitor provided you're not a professional gamer.The adjustable stand on this monitor received a lot of hate when I was reading reviews before I decided to purchase it. I have to say, I don't agree with the negative reviews about the stand. I find the adjustable stand to be quite convenient and work well. It has all the adjustments you'll need to get the screen in the perfect position for you. The base of the stand is kind of huge and I'm not sure it's completely necessary. But again, not really all that important.One of my favorite features of the monitor is the built in speaker. This is no lousy speaker, it is actually quite loud and pretty clear! When I'm tired of using my headset for FPS, I appreciate the fact it has a reliable speaker. This may not matter to many of you because you use external speakers, but for those that don't, or don't want to spend the extra money on external speakers, this is another win for you.Bottom line, this is a phenomenal monitor for gaming and as a second monitor for your PC/Mac. Spend the money on something you're going to spend a lot of time using, you'll really appreciate it in the end. By the way, 2K is a really nice touch as well when it comes to a nice picture.",15,39,24,54,72.2222222222222,27.7777777777778,"  unless youre  professional gamer competing   highest level  really dont need  response time  ms   gaming monitor   words  really dont need  tn panel often found  benq monitors    models  definitely   popular dont get  wrong benq makes phenomenal monitors   youre like    picture qualitycolor matters  recommend purchasing  ips monitor    newer technology  provides better color  quality  knock  ips monitors   getting  response time lower  ms   difficult like  mentioned  unless youre  professional gamer   likely  wont even notice  difference   youtube  pretty competitive gaming     notice  difference   ms benq  ms acer playing  flinch reaction game cod now   talking    flat screen tv compared    monitor youll definitely notice  difference   response time   large tv will likely   response time closer  ms believe    tell   will absolutely notice  difference   quality ips compared   quality tn monitor  tn panels color will look washed   times  course resolution plays  factor     talking  console gaming    p fps   max youre going  get   time   reviewnow        way heres  review   actual monitor lets  clear    premium monitor   years ago   monitor released  cost   yes  monitor    years old    gaming monitor  second display   lot  money  question   now   monitor    years old  asus  newer models  much  money  monitor   steal  asus monitors  least   experience    thicker side  far  physical dimensions     older technology  asus still makes monitors   thicker   said    thicker monitor  keep   mind   purchase   thick   point  annoying   deal breaker   isnt  thin  say  acer models     market  thats perhaps  end   negative part   reviewim reviewing  monitor   gaming  second monitor perspective   use  monitor   lets talk    important part  picture  monitor looks good  picture   clear  crisp  colors pop    really enjoyable visual experience  going    huge upgrade  just   tn panels  entry level ips monitors  truly enjoy  nice picture   willing  sacrifice  little response time  monitor  well worth   promise   picture qualitycolor  important    stop reading  add  monitor   cart  wont regret     really    important part   comes   monitor provided youre   professional gamerthe adjustable stand   monitor received  lot  hate    reading reviews   decided  purchase     say  dont agree   negative reviews   stand  find  adjustable stand   quite convenient  work well     adjustments youll need  get  screen   perfect position    base   stand  kind  huge  im  sure  completely necessary    really   importantone   favorite features   monitor   built  speaker    lousy speaker   actually quite loud  pretty clear  im tired  using  headset  fps  appreciate  fact    reliable speaker  may  matter  many     use external speakers     dont  dont want  spend  extra money  external speakers   another win  youbottom line    phenomenal monitor  gaming    second monitor   pcmac spend  money  something youre going  spend  lot  time using youll really appreciate    end   way k   really nice touch  well   comes   nice picture

"31","I this my second unit from Amazon.  The first one had a couple of imperfections (some type of speck or smudge underneath the panel).  After several days, decided RMA due to the distraction one of the imperfections caused.  Other than those issues, the monitor worked as advertised and had a terrific picture.  No noticeable backlight bleed (other than the standard IPS/PLS glow which is normal).  RMA was quick and painless and replacement arrived next day.  You can't ask for anything better.  This replacement is perfect.  No imperfections or dead pixels to be found.  No noticeable backlight bleed on this one either.  I highly recommend using the calibrated settings and ICC profile for this monitor found on the tftcentral.co.uk site.  Out of box settings are ok, but way too bright.  Some points of consideration if deciding between this and the Dell U2713HM:The ASUS uses PWM backlighting  (which can be a minus).  The Dell does notASUS: internal speakers  Dell: usb 3.0 hubASUS will do 1:1 pixel ratio for certain resolutions, the Dell does notASUS will do WQHD resolution from HDMI, the Dell will notAfter debating between the two.  Based on feedback from various forums, the Dell seems to have more issues with quality control.  (Flaky USB hub, image retention, blacklight bleed)  Of course each unit is different.  Check various forums and decide for yourself.  Personally for me this ASUS suited my needs better.One final note: Displayport may not wake-up after monitor goes to sleep.  Not sure if this affects NVIDIA folks, I am on an AMD Radeon.

"34","These comments are after one month of use.....I may update this at a later date:First....very impressed with this monitor. I have an expensive ($500+ on sale) high end IPS monitor (Dell Ultrasharp) sitting a few feet away, and it's awesome, but not a whole lot better than this cheaper version E-IPS panel. Bought the Asus to run with a secondary machine so I wouldn't have to use my gaming rig when I need a desktop.Made a few adjustments with color being a bit strong out-of-the-box, and other minor tweaks, but that's about it. Beautiful screen with very good viewing angles. Monitor ships with stand attached, so nothing to put together. Stand is solid with every adjustment you could want, which is a luxury on the cheaper monitors.Had one or two stuck red pixels on the upper right hand corner of the screen, just barely on the edge. No huge deal but you always want a new monitor to be flawless. Turns out they fixed themselves (just disappeared) after it warmed up, not giving me the chance to try any of the various free fixes found online. (I probably wouldn't have returned it to Amazon anyway, given their location on screen... too minor of an issue).Also...this monitor has little, if any, back light bleed.I've used Asus motherboards and other products for years, which are excellent, but this is my first monitor from them. Noticed that they consistently get good reviews at other sites as well, so I'd been checking them out for a while.Since I wouldn't own a TN panel, this PB238Q is outstanding in all aspects at this price ($215.99 at the time)",2,18,16,20,90,10,"   comments   one month  usei may update    later datefirstvery impressed   monitor    expensive   sale high end ips monitor dell ultrasharp sitting   feet away   awesome    whole lot better   cheaper version eips panel bought  asus  run   secondary machine   wouldnt   use  gaming rig   need  desktopmade   adjustments  color   bit strong outofthebox   minor tweaks  thats   beautiful screen   good viewing angles monitor ships  stand attached  nothing  put together stand  solid  every adjustment   want    luxury   cheaper monitorshad one  two stuck red pixels   upper right hand corner   screen just barely   edge  huge deal   always want  new monitor   flawless turns   fixed  just disappeared   warmed   giving   chance  try    various free fixes found online  probably wouldnt  returned   amazon anyway given  location  screen  minor   issuealsothis monitor  little   back light bleedive used asus motherboards   products  years   excellent     first monitor   noticed   consistently get good reviews   sites  well  id  checking     whilesince  wouldnt   tn panel  pbq  outstanding   aspects   price    time

"36","I was hesitant due to mixed reviews and reported issues with the panels used in this model and the other manufacturers' 32in 1440p monitors. Received the item - original packaging nested inside a HUGE box with plenty of packing materials to prevent jostling. No issues with display other than a very small blemish about 2-3 pixels big noticeable on a white screen. No dead pixels, and the blemish is hardly distinguishable from a speck of dust. I'm pretty finicky, so if I had bought this at a brick and mortar I would have exchanged/continued to exchange until I received a panel with absolutely no flaws. The very minor blemish was not enough for me to go through the hassle of repackaging and shipping back.The stand is super sturdy. The swivel function is a bit tight and requires one hand to hold the stand to prevent the base from turning with the screen. Maybe a surface with more friction would eliminate this issue. My desk is a natural wood ikea table top. My secondary monitor didn't have the range of motion of this ASUS and I probably wouldn't buy another monitor that wasn't as adjustable as this - unless it was VESA compatible and I planned on an aftermarket stand.Controls are easy to use after a little learning since they are not labeled on the front (I prefer the cleaner bezel look). Rather than hunting for the correct button I tend to use the ""joystick"" for adjusting settings, which I don't often do.I'm running DisplayPort for my PC and HDMI for my Xbox One. Another input would be nice for Chromecast.The screen is nice and bright and blacks are pretty deep. It's about as close to true black as I've seen in a screen that isn't OLED or plasma. Due to the size, colors may shift a tad in the corners when viewing the screen from 24 inches and closer. I've only noticed this with red images. It's very very minor. Viewing angles are acceptable.There's a bit of minor ghosting as expected due to the response time, but I'm able to play FPS games without issue. If you're used to a super low response time (1-2ms) it may be a bit annoying at first. I was used to the 2ms of my SyncMaster PX2370 so I had to adjust a bit. The trade-off of a lot more screen real-estate to view reference materials on one side of the screen while writing on the other as well as the utility of the screen size to serve as the ""TV"" in the guest bedroom/office is worth the slightly higher response time to me. It's worth having a decent gpu to run 1440p @75Hz. The difference between 60 and 75Hz is pretty noticeable. I wouldn't recommend running at 1080p if you're planning on using the monitor at the normal distance sitting at a desk. It is fine from a further distance (like a couch). I'm running a GTX 970 and I wouldn't recommend going any lower than that to run most things at 1440p @ 75Hz. I'm not the type to chase benchmarks. I had to turn down a few settings from Ultra on Witcher 3 and Battlefield 1 to maintain the resolution and refresh rate. The benefit of 1440p to me is that anti aliasing isn't quite as important at least to me. The higher resolution decreases noticeable aliasing.Good: Great stand, solid construction, good settings out of the box, no major issues with panel or construction. Nice image. Few options at this size, let alone at this price point.Bad: One minor blemish, not major enough to warrant a return. Only 1 HDMI input.Notes: 1440p @75Hz may push your current GPU if you haven't upgraded in a while and you plan on doing any gaming.

We should have run for the hills then and just replaced it, but it randomly worked so we thought maybe the cable was the problem. Within four months we never unplugged our laptop, knowing that it would take over an hour of poking and prodding and hoping that the monitor would connect again. Finally, it just stopped connecting at all. We bought a new cable, we tried different computers... nothing. The good news? We contacted Asus and we are under warranty. The bad news?

The benefits of 4k far outweigh the 144hz.When you first start using the monitor everything looks really small. Using windows 7 I had to adjust for the text size in the settings. Its easy to do. Everything looks so crisp and your eyes get used to it after a few days. With windows 7 there are are some little annoyances but you start to figure them out and after about a month of use, I don't even realize them anymore. I often.I find myself only using a small portion of the screen as the 28"" is huge! I can easily put 4 applications on the screen and be able to use them all very comfortably. It seems really large at first and just like everything else, you get used to it. 28 inches is a really nice size.Gaming is really good in 4k, 60hz in 4k seems very smooth. I play Battlefield and Insurgency and I really have a hard time catching frames, I have tried switching back and forth from the 144hz and the 4k and I swear the 4k looks better and feels better. When I put headphones in and play I notice a huge difference in heart rates and the feel just is way better on the 4k.Do note that I power this monitor with two GTX 970's running in SLI. If you plan on gaming at all, this is the minimum needed to get a comfortable 60 frames per second.Overall I am really glad I switched to this monitor and think it is a huge upgrade from the 1080p 144hz monitor I had. If you can't decide if you want to give up 144hz for 4k, just do it.

"41","This monitor is PHENOMENAL. The colors are fantastic and the quality is really clean and sharp.

"42","The packing I received the monitor in was fine, but the monitor itself was terribly disappointing - there seems to be a complete lack of QA of any sort. The entire bottom edge has a dark shadow, the exact opposite of backlight bleed. There's one spot that's especially bad and very noticeable. Unfortunately, the service network in India is atrocious - the representatives visited and checked out the monitor, confirming it was a manufacturing defect and submitting the report, but refused to fix the problem - instead they asked me to send it back to Amazon.This would make sense if I was in the USA, but sending it back internationally is a almost as expensive as the monitor itself (Amazon isn't giving me a prepaid shipping option) and will put my credit card on the dock for both this monitor plus taxes and shipping, plus international return shipping, plus a new monitor plus taxes and shipping that I'll need to replace this, which I just can't afford.The panel feels okay otherwise, but it just doesn't come close in quality to the Dell panels I've seen, albeit the lower resolution ones.Not to mention that the price of the monitor dropped immediately after I bought it :-/ That's just adding insult to injury.",14,1,-13,15,6.66666666666667,93.3333333333333,"   packing  received  monitor   fine   monitor   terribly disappointing   seems    complete lack  qa   sort  entire bottom edge   dark shadow  exact opposite  backlight bleed theres one spot thats especially bad   noticeable unfortunately  service network  india  atrocious   representatives visited  checked   monitor confirming    manufacturing defect  submitting  report  refused  fix  problem  instead  asked   send  back  amazonthis  make sense      usa  sending  back internationally   almost  expensive   monitor  amazon isnt giving   prepaid shipping option  will put  credit card   dock    monitor plus taxes  shipping plus international return shipping plus  new monitor plus taxes  shipping  ill need  replace    just cant affordthe panel feels okay otherwise   just doesnt come close  quality   dell panels ive seen albeit  lower resolution onesnot  mention   price   monitor dropped immediately   bought   thats just adding insult  injury

"43","I bought this monitor because after weeks of looking and shopping around I finally decided on the Asus PA248Q. Now, I know what you're saying, this isn't that. True. Honestly, the reason I got the PB248Q is because the PA inexplicably jumped in price from 320 dollars to $450 in a five day span. After trying for days to find out the differences between the two I couldn't come up with anything solid that translated to $200 in my head, so I got it. From what I understand difference #1 comes in the form of a color test prior to shipping. I conducted a test myself and found my screen to be well within the acceptable range of color out of the box, and this is something you should do on occasion, so I'm not sure if that's worth the price difference. Difference #2 is an inch. I could honestly do without the speakers. They are tinny and muddled. They don't put out a lot, despite the sound system being called HD it really isn't. I would much rather Asus made a PC248Q that was $50 cheaper and had no speakers. Despite the speaker quality I am not removing any points for that because a. I never expect much from monitor speakers, and b. I couldn't care less about them. If you're buying a monitor and speakers are going to sway your opinion get whatever one you want because odds are you're not worried about the quality of your picture too much.The picture! Here's the fun part. It's gorgeous. 80 mil:1 contrast ratio at this price sweetens the deal a great bit.What I've used it for so far,Gaming (farcry 3 and Assassin's Creed 3)Watching movies in 1080pediting photosediting videosI ramped up the visual quality on the games to see if I could catch anything but this screen took it like a champ. Everything looked beautiful. Photo editing was great. My photos have never looked this gorgeous. I actually had to go back and re-edit some of my old stuff because of how good this monitor made my bad. Like I said, out of the box everything was spot on. The grid I thought I'd never use because what editing software doesn't have that feature? But it's so easy to just turn on with the click of a button on the monitor. So I will be using the feature a lot I imagine.The build: This monitor's base is a tank. The whole thing is really nice, and it feels like it could survive an A bomb. When I took it out of the box to set it up as I turned around I bumped into the corner of the monitor. IT GAVE ME A DEADARM! Seriously! I was amazed. The thing barely wobbled and took me out of commission for a minute or two, lol. Turning the monitor felt reliable and sturdy at any height. It made sharing my computer really easy. I love the ruler'ed edges. It's a nice touch. Turning the monitor 90 degrees was one smooth fluid motion. My one complaint about the build is the button placement. When I go to raise or lower the screen I tend to grab it from the sides. I also tend to hit the buttons on the side when I do this. Putting the buttons on the bottom or top of the monitor seems like a better option to me, but eventually, even the top becomes the side. I'm not thrilled with the navigation of the menu options, but that's more or less because I'm not used to them. So this can result in fumbling with the buttons until things go away. Especially in the dark.Addressing complaints on this monitor/Light Bleed: I see none. I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about honestly. At it's brightest I saw no bleed.too bright: It was very easy to swap to theater mode, which greatly dampened the brightness. It was also very easy to just adjust the brightness settings. Out of the box it seemed bright, but my eyes adjusted quickly and it wasn't an issue for me.Packaging:The monitor came with anything you would want to use to connect except HDMI. It came set up on the stand well protected. I was worried because this is the first time I have bought a monitor online. But the foam it comes cased in is strong. A ups driver would've had to have a rough day to damage this thing. There was a film on the screen. Polish maybe? I used a soft cloth to wipe it off and it was fine.(the comp I used to base this review on is comprised of, Intel Core I7, EVGA 660, Gigabyte z77x motherboard)So, here's the bad part. The second or third day I had this monitor it made a high pitched squeal when it was turned on. It only happened after it was off for an extended period of time. If I turned the monitor on and off it would go away. But after the first time it happened almost every day. So I got a replacement from Amazon, and it did the same thing. I posted a question about it here, and followed the steps to see if it would work. None of them did. It wasn't my computer, it wasn't anything else in my apartment. From what I understand it was a capacitor loading up. A power supply issue. (Not my first Asus product with power supply issues). I contacted Asus customer service and they were a joke. The only two answers given me were send it in for repair (not happening with a brand new monitor thanks) or return it to Amazon. I contacted Amazon, told them what was going on, asked for a third replacement and they told me no. They then stopped carrying the product (although it is available thru other sellers it is no longer an Amazon certified purchase), and the informed me they would no longer carry the monitor until an investigation was done. Since another PB would likely be defective they opted not to replace it. I almost considered keeping it and dealing with the buzz but not at $250. I tried to post a video of the defect on Amazon but the file size was too big.So here I sit. It was an awesome monitor if Asus could get their act together and not cheap out on the power supply.

I got it for programming and gaming, and it gives me plenty of space to do so!**update**I initially stated that there wasn't any dead pixels but I recently spotted one in the middle of my screen after about a week and a half of use. I also noticed what looks like dust under the AG coating. I have a replacement on the way, hopefully this one doesn't have any defects. I wouldn't mind a dead pixel if the monitor wasn't so expensive.**update**So I have gone through 4 of these monitors, all of which have had pixel defects. I don't understand how others are getting panels without any defects... I must have horrible luck. Anyways, I ended up keeping one that has 2 almost unnoticeable dead pixels in the top left.

"46","This monitor is the best bang for the buck for 4k gaming right now.  The first thing I did is upgrade skyrim to the 4k texture pack and set the monitor to Display Port 1.2.  Some people have complained that the buttons that are located on the lower backside of the monitor are difficult to use, while the buttons aren't super convenient, they are easy enough to use.I was unable to use my PC at 4k.  Things are just too small.  I ended up setting the resolution to 1080p for everyday use.  The monitor isn't nearly as sharp as it is at 4k.I would like to note that skyrim at 4k is fantastic.  I am using a Gigabyte R9 290 video card and skyrim was great at 4k.The annoying things are with the AMD drivers in windows 7 x 64. If the operating system shuts off the monitor, it would never wake up.  Hooking and unhooking the connection and turning the monitor on and off had no effect.  The only way to get the system to show video again is to reboot the computer.  Gigabyte email tech support for the video card was painfully slow.  They would reply to me once a day and ask a new question each time.  After about a week of this I found on my own that the monitor did not have the  correct monitor in the device manager.  It was a generic PnP monitor.  I upgraded that to the latest monitor drivers and the problem with waking up went away.  There is still some issue with the monitor going to sleep though.  Sometimes my system will blue screen when waking up the monitor.  Until the drivers catch up with this display, I would recommend setting the ""turn off my monitor after"" setting to Never and simply turn off the monitor when you step away from the computer.Even with the annoying driver problems, this monitor gets 5 stars.  It isn't perfect, but I am very satisfied.EDIT:  Latest video drivers fixed the monitor wake up problem.",11,15,4,26,57.6923076923077,42.3076923076923,"   monitor   best bang   buck  k gaming right now   first thing    upgrade skyrim   k texture pack  set  monitor  display port    people  complained   buttons   located   lower backside   monitor  difficult  use   buttons arent super convenient   easy enough  usei  unable  use  pc  k  things  just  small   ended  setting  resolution  p  everyday use   monitor isnt nearly  sharp     ki  like  note  skyrim  k  fantastic    using  gigabyte r  video card  skyrim  great  kthe annoying things    amd drivers  windows  x    operating system shuts   monitor   never wake   hooking  unhooking  connection  turning  monitor      effect    way  get  system  show video    reboot  computer  gigabyte email tech support   video card  painfully slow    reply     day  ask  new question  time     week    found      monitor      correct monitor   device manager     generic pnp monitor   upgraded    latest monitor drivers   problem  waking  went away    still  issue   monitor going  sleep though  sometimes  system will blue screen  waking   monitor    drivers catch    display   recommend setting  turn   monitor  setting  never  simply turn   monitor   step away   computereven   annoying driver problems  monitor gets  stars   isnt perfect     satisfiededit  latest video drivers fixed  monitor wake  problem

"47","There are plenty of long reviews of this monitor, so I'll keep it fairly brief.  I am a semi-pro photographer (not my full time job) and I was looking for an upgrade for photo editing. Most importantly that the printer print what the monitor displays.  I got that right out of the box on this.  I did try to have it calibrated professionally using CalMAN and it had major problems.  The display looked fine but the pictures looked like a nuclear bomb went off.  it was terrible.  The key though is that the calibration made so few adjustments that  it is not noticed.My photos are SHARP, color is rich and not saturated, skin tones are excellent, and I confidently edit wedding photos with this monitor.  I would have to see a monitor that costs thousands before I comment on the actual difference, but there is NO WAY I would purchase one.Gaming...well, I did purchase the ASUS 144hz gaming monitor and thought I would use both: one for editing and one for gaming.  Not necessary.  This monitor does everything I need it to do and the image, the games look AMAZING.  The character detail is outstanding.This monitor is outstanding.

"49","I'm not going to write out a ton on info on this monitor, aif you want a really long review for check out Toms hardwares 10 page review on this, its filled with tons of tests and comparisons and everything else you could want. I do want to say that if your looking for a 4k monitor that is affordable and has a nice image/features this is the best one to get. It's leagues better than the cheap china seike ones that have been out for a year now and a lot better than the compatible monitors from Samsung, Dell, Phillips, and others for a similar price. The image is absolutely fantastic its shocking when you see it first time. This monitor is perfect for averything other than PROFESSIONAL color grading, which you would want a $3000 model for. If you do editing but not a pro colorist this one should be fine for you, along with anything else you would want a 4k dislay for including gaming.

"51","I purchased this monitor several months ago.  Last week, I received a new monitor the Samsung 28 inch 4K.  I am running both using the same graphic card GeForce GTX780.  I loved the ASUS monitor. Now with the addition of the Samsung 4K I realized to what extend the ASUS colors, sharpness, depth and vividness are far superior to the Samsung (regardless how much color adjustments I made on the Samsung).  Samsung offers more pixel however with almost identical screen sizes the extra pixels are not that relevant for every day use.  I now realize that for most PC applications, the ASUS 2560x1440 is more practical and has much better picture.  The 4K would only make sense for sizes over 32 inches to provide space for multiple applications.

"52","I love this display!  I am a Linux user, and it just worked right out of the box, no special settings required.  In fact, I kept my current monitor hooked up, and it recognized both and set up dual monitor configuration.This panel is *perfect*.  No defects.  No dead pixels or other quality problems. Very effective packaging with double boxes and lots of foam.  I hooked it up using HDMI, and it immediately synced at 60Hz without my having to adjust a thing.Since this monitor is not 4K, there were no problems scaling.  Lots of screen real estate, so I bumped up the font size just a bit as I'm older, and my eyes are not as sharp as they once were.  I set my settings to force fonts to 120 DPI, and it worked extremely well, and made fonts much clearer and easier to read.  If you do a lot of reading as I do, it's a very good monitor for that, as it has special settings for color and brightness so that it's easy on the eyes, and it have five presets for adjusting blue light down so that it doesn't interfere with sleep.  The on screen display to configure the monitor is easy to use.It comes with cables to connect HDMI, Displayport or DVI, VGA, audio and for USB passthrough.I'm a programmer, and I play strategy games and watch videos.I can turn the monitor sideways, change the orientation to portrait, and read a *ton* of text, whether it's a book or code.Movies with a lot of dark or poorly lit scenes are amazing and show a lot more detail that my old monitor, a Samsung  22BW.  Contrast is greater than on any monitor I've seen.  It has a ""Darkroom"" mode that I didn't know about, that dims the screen perfectly for night use, and it's very easy to select in the OSD.Photo editing is a dream on this thing.  The large screen area means that I can load large photos and I don't have to scroll or adjust.  Colors are truly amazing.  I'm a photographer, and I'm thrilled with the color accuracy.  Photos that have fog actually *look* like fog instead of just washed out.The design is clean and simple and effective.  The stand holds the screen firmly but moving the screen takes only the lightest touch, and it's very configurable.  I like being able to lift it up so that I'm not hunched over, I can sit up straight.The viewing angle is quite good, and my family can all watch a movie together from different angles without color shift.I have ordered a faster graphics card to drive this unit, as I have a Geforce GT720, and while it works better than I expected, I have noticed that there is some stuttering on some games and on very detailed movies with action scenes.  It's subtle, but it's there.  The new Geforce GTX 970 should fix that.  I will update this review and report on the differences.  The new card will have Displayport, and I want to drive this monitor at 75Hz, as it requires Displayport 1.2 (the monitor comes with version 1.1 as default) and a high end graphics card.  The manual has a list of supported cards.One slight criticism is that this monitor did not come with a manual, but I did find that online on ASUS's website support link.I didn't take any points off because manuals are pretty easy to obtain online, but this would be a problem if the display didn't function properly, and while this was not a problem for me, as the setup was a breeze, if things went wrong for some reason, it would be difficult.  Not much of an issue for those upgrading from an older monitor, which is going to be the case for many.  Also, once manuals are printed and shipped, inevitably something requires a change to the manual, and most manuals are now found online.If you're looking for a 32 inch monitor, and you're not sure what to get, you deserve to give this monitor a look.

"53","I was previously using 3 x ASUS VG278HE and replaced the middle screen with this one.I was expecting to be blown away and am not.All 3 monitors are in SRGB mode, and the colors are quite similar. This 32"" screen's resolution is marginally better that the 1920 x1080 @27"", but not that much crisper.I bought this screen as a ""transitional"" screen more out of frustration than necessity, waiting for Acer and Asus to get their act together on QC, especially on their IPS models.This screen is very uniform (as expected), and their is no light bleed (also as expected) (Since it's not an IPS or variant thereof.)I have all three screens on 125% scaling win 7, and all looks normal.I did notice the Titans in my Nvidia panel only offer 8 bit color? Not sure about 10 bit color. The color is a little better than on my TN panels, but nothing to write home about.I want to be blown away but cannot find any monitor in 2016 that has done so. I do not think 2560x1440 is enough for a 32"", I think I should have stuck to 27"". I will play Doom later on @75hz, and compare to 144hz, but am not expecting to get excited.On the other hand I am happy I have not bought an IPS with all the lottery attributed to these.UPDATE 10-19I have had this monitor for a few days now. I suppose I grateful because it is very uniform all over, but the colors are simply not as rich as I would expect them to be. It's quite sad, that the only thing I love about this monitor is that it is defect free.I also own a Sony XBR tv, and am spoiled by the deep colors the TV offers. I have no clue what panels Sony use on their high end Tv's but it makes this monitor color's look anemic and pale in comparison.Again, I think Tom's review is highly overrated.I have been studying monitors religiously for the past year, trying to find something which is problem free, offers great colors, and is also a class 1 or 2 for gaming. I cannot find anything.I have researched monitors for hours and days. No other product I have owned or wanted to buy has ever warranted this time-consuming research. IMO, a house for example is easier to buy than a monitor.UPDATE 10/24/2016I just purchased an ASUS VA32AQ to compare.This monitor (ASUS PB328Q) is much better. The ASUS VA32AQ should be avoided. Very cheap IPS panel, with terrible contrast and color.UPDATE 11/05/2015I have had this monitor for nearly one month now, and will give it a final rating of 5 stars. Blacks are so deep, oranges look way better on this  amva than on an IPS. Greens and reds look ever so slightly better on an IPS. Uniformity on this panel is great.

"54","I purchased this monitor after reading the glowing Tom's Hardware review that made it sound like one of the best monitors you can buy for the money. I generally agree.VA vs IPS:One of the main things that drew me to this monitor was that it was a VA panel which gives superb contrast and much better viewing angles than TN (but not as good as IPS). I use a 27"" iMac at work and my roommates Asus PB278Q IPS/PLS screen. Compared to those IPS screens the color is not quite as vivid and bright, but still much better than any TN panel I have used. The reason I chose VA over IPS for this 32"" screen is to avoid the IPS glow. I play a lot of dark video games and while using the Asus PB278Q 27"" IPS screen I noticed some IPS glow around the edges. It was distracting enough that it pushed me over to VA to avoid it, ESPECIALLY on a 32"" screen where the larger angles would further increase glow. On the other hand my iMac IPS work screen is perfect in the bright office lighting. So if you use your screen in brightly lit areas I would recommend an IPS screen for the vivid colors. If you are looking for fantastic contrast and want to avoid IPS glow I would pick a VA screen.Responsiveness:I use my computer primarily for gaming so screen lag is something I worry about. I have heard stories of VA panels being slow. In short, this screen is very responsive. Moving from a TN pannel I noticed no increased screen lag. Part of the reason I picked this screen over the BenQ BL3200PT is that it has lower lag (tomshardware has the BenQ at 76 for absolute input lag vs the Asus at 41). This screen also runs at 75hz over display port which is a great addition.Color and settings:Overall the colors are very good and neutral. I never realized how off the whites on my older screens were until I compared it to the neutral white of this screen. As good as they are they didn't WOW me like the IPS screens I have used, but I think the contrast tradeoff is worth it. Overall they are still much better than any TN panels which I have used.On the topic of color I want to address the settings of the monitor. I made the adjustments that Tom's Hardware recommended BUT you should turn VividPixel off. It increases the contrast around the edges of shapes but in reality it gives everything a weird boarder.I would also like to point out that my screen has NO dead pixels and the backlighting is very uniform.The monitor is also very physically attractive and the stand is ROCK SOLID and very easy to move.Once you go 2650x1440 you'll never go back. I think that is the perfect resolution for a 32"".Overall for the money (I paid $575) this is hits all of the important considerations general use, movies, and gaming.",10,36,26,46,78.2608695652174,21.7391304347826,"   purchased  monitor  reading  glowing toms hardware review  made  sound like one   best monitors  can buy   money  generally agreeva vs ipsone   main things  drew    monitor      va panel  gives superb contrast  much better viewing angles  tn    good  ips  use   imac  work   roommates asus pbq ipspls screen compared   ips screens  color   quite  vivid  bright  still much better   tn panel   used  reason  chose va  ips    screen   avoid  ips glow  play  lot  dark video games   using  asus pbq  ips screen  noticed  ips glow around  edges   distracting enough   pushed    va  avoid  especially    screen   larger angles   increase glow    hand  imac ips work screen  perfect   bright office lighting    use  screen  brightly lit areas   recommend  ips screen   vivid colors    looking  fantastic contrast  want  avoid ips glow   pick  va screenresponsivenessi use  computer primarily  gaming  screen lag  something  worry    heard stories  va panels  slow  short  screen   responsive moving   tn pannel  noticed  increased screen lag part   reason  picked  screen   benq blpt     lower lag tomshardware   benq    absolute input lag vs  asus    screen also runs  hz  display port    great additioncolor  settingsoverall  colors   good  neutral  never realized    whites   older screens    compared    neutral white   screen  good     didnt wow  like  ips screens   used   think  contrast tradeoff  worth  overall   still much better   tn panels    usedon  topic  color  want  address  settings   monitor  made  adjustments  toms hardware recommended    turn vividpixel   increases  contrast around  edges  shapes   reality  gives everything  weird boarderi  also like  point    screen   dead pixels   backlighting   uniformthe monitor  also  physically attractive   stand  rock solid   easy  moveonce  go x youll never go back  think    perfect resolution   overall   money  paid    hits    important considerations general use movies  gaming

"57","I haven't had it long, but I calibrated it with a Spyder4Pro, and I can report that, with the full gray scale displayed, 242 and 255 are so distinct from one another that there is room for intermediate steps. At the same time. 12 and 0 are distinct but with no room left between 12 and black. On the test chart, cauc flesh is dead on and without off cast. Grays are neutral. Color patches look right, meaning that red is not the semi-magenta that so often appears. Spyder finds is good for sRGB. It is very sharp, showing true image detail.I would not expect, at this price, for it to match high-end graphics displays, but for what I want, which is to produce large photo images that will pass exacting stock agency reviewers, it is obviously going to do just fine. When I pull the test chart back to the common Dell 19"" monitor, the difference is shocking. I am VERY happy I'm not preping photo submissions on the Dell. (No slur on the Dell - it's not supposed to compete).I bought this one from Amazon Warehouse as an open-box with minor damage to the top of the monitor. I didn't see the damage while setting up, so it's of no consequence. All in all, it's a perfectly adequate monitor if you're not doing low tolerance color work indeed. So five stars for performance well up to expectations.I want to add this one note. You will note that the instructions with calibration sets, like Spyder and Colormunki, advise to let the monitor warm up for 30 minutes before calibration. I know that when this one wakes up, it has a distinct green cast, in terms of diachroic filter densities in old color film printing, I would call it ""5"" green. 30 minutes may be more than enough, but do not judge or calibrate your monitor until it warms up.

"59","This is indeed a professional grade graphics monitor.  I'm upgrading from dual NEC Multi-Sync P221W monitors, which have been great for years, to get a larger screen with higher resolution.  I was able to compare the same 16-bit TIFF image on the Asus PB278Q and the latest 27"" Apple Thunderbolt.  On paper, they have identical screen specs.  However, the Asus looks a bit sharper, in spite of the matte screen, slightly wider viewing angles and smoother color.  The Apple screen has deeper apparent blacks, thanks to the glossy screen.CalibrationFor calibration, I use the X-Rite Color Munki Photo.  After attaching the new Asus monitor, my system didn't recognize the Color Munki device.  Re-installing the Color Munki drivers fixed the issue.The monitor has several different screen mode under the ""Splendid"" menu. I used sRGB mode and the Color Munki advanced mode to set the color.  Side by side with the NEC monitor, color checkers look identical.ResolutionThe 2560x1440 image is stunning, especially compared to an HD monitor.PerformanceI'm using an NVIDIA Quadro 600 card with 1GB memory that is a couple of years old.  No complaints for video playback.  However, I noticed something odd - Photoshop processing is suddenly almost double the speed now.  I expected, if anything, the opposite now that the card has more screen to fill.

"60","I love the high resolution, beautiful colors, and clear text of Mac OS X Yosemite on my 27"" iMac at work. So for home I wanted a monitor that would get me as close as possible to the quality of the Apple iMac display with my modest Mac Mini. The easy path to high resolution would be an Apple Thunderbolt Display but I did not love its immodest sticker price. With a little research I found that the Asus PB278Q might give me the high resolution, color dynamics, and crisp fonts of an iMac/Thunderbolt for less than half of the cost.When I first plugged in my Asus to my Mac Mini using a Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter I got a shock... my Mac Mini didn't recognize the 2560 x 1440 resolution of the Asus. The highest the Mac Mini and the Asus could give me as an unimpressive 1920 x 1080. With a bit more research I found that the problem was my Mini DisplayPort adaptor. The Asus doesn't have s DisplayPort port. And the Mac Mini can't pump out 2560 x 1140 over an Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter.I needed to use a Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter--a pricy contraption with three connectors: DisplayPort, DVI, and USB. The USB connector is used to provide power to the Dual-Link adapter so that the Mac Mini can support 2560 x 1440. Awesome!Except that there was one snag... The Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter is huge. And the Asus has a lip across below all it's ports in the back that prevents the Dual-Link adapter from plugging into the monitor's DVI port. Even the cables that ship with the ASUS are hard to maneuver into their corresponding ports because of that darn lip. (Note to industrial designers: keep access to all ports clear! It's the back of the monitor so it does not have to look pretty.) Luckily I found that the DVI cable that ships with the Asus works with the Dual-Link adapter. My Asus monitor and Mac Mini are working perfectly together and I'm getting full the 2560 x 1140 resolution of the Apple Thunderbolt display without paying for it.Other things I like about the Asus PB278Q:- The stand allows you to raise the monitor up to eye-level, which really important for your neck!- The built in menu system is pretty easy to navigate with several ""Splendid"" display modes. sRGB mode works the best for me.- The on/off control is easy to reach and not hidden away.",5,21,16,26,80.7692307692308,19.2307692307692,"   love  high resolution beautiful colors  clear text  mac os x yosemite    imac  work   home  wanted  monitor   get   close  possible   quality   apple imac display   modest mac mini  easy path  high resolution    apple thunderbolt display     love  immodest sticker price   little research  found   asus pbq might give   high resolution color dynamics  crisp fonts   imacthunderbolt  less  half   costwhen  first plugged   asus   mac mini using  mini displayport  dvi adapter  got  shock  mac mini didnt recognize   x  resolution   asus  highest  mac mini   asus  give    unimpressive  x    bit  research  found   problem   mini displayport adaptor  asus doesnt  s displayport port   mac mini cant pump   x    mini displayport  dvi adapteri needed  use  mini displayport  duallink dvi adaptera pricy contraption  three connectors displayport dvi  usb  usb connector  used  provide power   duallink adapter    mac mini can support  x  awesomeexcept    one snag  mini displayport  duallink dvi adapter  huge   asus   lip across    ports   back  prevents  duallink adapter  plugging   monitors dvi port even  cables  ship   asus  hard  maneuver   corresponding ports    darn lip note  industrial designers keep access   ports clear   back   monitor       look pretty luckily  found   dvi cable  ships   asus works   duallink adapter  asus monitor  mac mini  working perfectly together  im getting full   x  resolution   apple thunderbolt display without paying  itother things  like   asus pbq  stand allows   raise  monitor   eyelevel  really important   neck  built  menu system  pretty easy  navigate  several splendid display modes srgb mode works  best    onoff control  easy  reach   hidden away

"63","Incredible resolution on this monitor, but with major issues. Using with a MacBook Pro (late 2013) over a mini-Displayport to Displayport 1.2 cable.  The monitor loses the signal randomly, going blank, then recovering. When the MacBook resumes from sleep, the display may or may not turn back on. Using the power button doesn't get the signal back, the power cable must be yanked sometimes. Each time the display loses the signal and resumes, the windows in the computer desktop are resized and jumbled.This display has been a huge regret for me. No firmware upgrade has been released. I've contacted Asus customer service. They don't acknowledge the issue, which seems to be well documented here and on various forums. They tell me to check my computer, cables, ports, etc. Everything but their product. I would return it, but while I was wasting time with Asus customer support, my return window closed.Update:  An Asus rep contacted me a while back in the comments.  I just saw it and I'm following up.  I still have the same problems running the latest Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10.  This monitor loses signal at least twice per day during regular work use.

"64","Been using this monitor for almost a year and I LOVE it!  I wanted an Apple Cinema Display but couldn't afford $1k, so after much research I settled on this monitor.  I've previously used several Asus monitors for other projects and was happy with them, but this was going to be my daily driver at my desk so it had to be perfect.  I'm happy to report that after all these months I'm still completely thrilled with it.I had a few hiccups when I first got it, all dealing with trying to get my Macbook Pro Retina 13 to drive the monitor at its full native resolution (which, BTW, is the same as the Apple Cinema Display).  None of these issues had to do with the monitor but with the way the MBPr handles external displays.  The MBPr only supports 1080 output over HDMI so that's not an option, and its DVI output isn't dual link either so it can't drive this many pixels.  Your only option is to connect the Asus via Displayport using a mini Displayport to Displayport adapter.  I bought one from here on Amazon but can't find it anymore.  It was a few bucks, and well worth it.The viewing angles on this monitor are insane, as is the brightness and color rendering.  Once calibrated, colors were pretty much dead on and I can gather folks around it at my desk without anyone complaining about not being able to see.  It's every bit as good as the Cinema Displays that several of my coworkers have, and I could have bought two of them for what they paid for one of theirs!",4,11,7,15,73.3333333333333,26.6666666666667,"   using  monitor  almost  year   love    wanted  apple cinema display  couldnt afford k   much research  settled   monitor  ive previously used several asus monitors   projects   happy      going    daily driver   desk      perfect  im happy  report     months im still completely thrilled  iti    hiccups   first got   dealing  trying  get  macbook pro retina   drive  monitor   full native resolution  btw      apple cinema display  none   issues      monitor    way  mbpr handles external displays   mbpr  supports  output  hdmi  thats   option   dvi output isnt dual link either   cant drive  many pixels    option   connect  asus via displayport using  mini displayport  displayport adapter   bought one    amazon  cant find  anymore      bucks  well worth itthe viewing angles   monitor  insane    brightness  color rendering   calibrated colors  pretty much dead    can gather folks around    desk without anyone complaining    able  see   every bit  good   cinema displays  several   coworkers      bought two      paid  one

"65","I do love it, but setting things up for 60Hz refresh requires a bit of help. I ordered this and the Nvidia GTX 980. As of writing this (Nov 22nd 2014) there is a major issue hitting a lot of people where the system will not cold boot if using a single monitor and the DisplayPort cable. Hangs after loading BIOS. This is NOT the monitor or supplied cable, it's the actual graphics driver. I have a dual monitor setup and I discovered that providing I use a DVI-I cable to the second monitor the bootup will take place on Monitor 2 and as soon as the Password page occurs it will swap over (auto) to the Main ASUS monitor.The monitor itself is crystal clear, excellent color reproduction and a near perfect viewing area. I do use the ColorMunky to ensure that color reproduction on the screen and printer match, but the monitor comes with a ""lot"" of choices for setting up you color preferences. Warning. First time in from a lower resolution monitor the icons that litter your screen will be really small, you can adjust the size easily.BUT the monitor come factory set using DisplayPort 1.1 (32 Hz only) and you must change this to 1.2 for 60Hz. You do that by opening the the on-screen menu >> System Setup >> DisplayPort Stream >> (select) 1.2. Using Nvidia (or whatever graphics card you are using) select under the PC header 3840X2160 (native) and change Refresh Rate to 60 Hz.Now your done.

"68","I do recommend this monitor if you are looking for a 4K one.  I think the higher price is worth it to get the IPS panel vs the cheaper TFT 4K panels.  Though not perfect, I gave this monitor five stars because it looks to be the best 4K IPS monitor available (for the price).///GOOD THINGS///-> THIN BEZELS  0.5-> MATTE BLACK PLASTIC - looks nice and doesnt attract fingerprints-> GREAT STAND - can be raised/lowered, tilted forward/backward, swiveled, or even rotated vertically-> MATTE SCREEN FINISH - not as vivid as glossier screens but no glare is the better trade-off)-> IPS SCREEN  Helps the colors to look more uniform  makes a big difference on a monitor this big.-> FLICKER-FREE SCREEN  Asus advertises this monitor as flicker-free  and I do get very little eyestrain using this monitor compared to others.-> 4K RESOLUTION  Its great.  As others have said, you need to enable DisplayPort 1.2 in the menu to get 4K at 60 Hz.  I also got a much better picture after setting the output dynamic range option in the nVidia control panel to full (it was at limited initially).  Regarding desktop scaling in Windows  4K at 150% scaling is about like 1440p at 100% scaling.  Trying to use this monitor at 100% scaling is pretty difficult  everythings really tiny but its nice to be able to fit so much on the screen at once.  I find that I like to use 125% scaling the best.  The 4K does make a big difference in games compared to 1440p  I especially like the higher resolution for strategy games.///BAD THINGS///-> SCREEN IMPERFECTIONS  a couple pixels are stuck red and a couple are dead  most of these have occurred months after buying which is worrisome  the good news is the pixels are so small its hard to notice.///NEUTRAL THINGS///-> BUILT-IN SPEAKERS  Cant hurt to have them but pretty mediocre sounding.  Volume can be adjusted in the monitors menu.  Built-in speakers can be disabled in the menu as well.-> NO DVI PORTS  Doesnt affect me but something to be aware of.-> IPS GLOW  The edges of the screen do look slightly brighter on a dark image  but the effect is no worse than it is on my MacBooks retina screen.  Ive found the IPS glow effect looks worse in pictures than it does in person.-> LOW BLUE LIGHT SETTING  Feature that makes the screen more yellowish to reduce eyestrain  it does help but isnt something I use much.  It can be set at five different levels (including off).-> VIVID PIXEL SETTING  I prefer this set to the default of zero.  Turning it on makes text look artificially sharp like turning up the sharpness too high on a TV.-> TRACE FREE SETTING -> Does make a difference when its on  if its off I notice the cursor blur more.  I like the default setting of 40 best.///INPUTS///-> 4 HDMI  These are not HDMI 2.0 ports.  You can use all four of them at the same time in PBP mode.-> 3.5mm audio in  can be assigned to any input-> 3.5mm audio out  good for connecting computer speakers to or headphones.  Note that the quality is limited to 16 bit, 48 kHz.-> 1 DisplayPort (DP) and 1 mini-DisplayPort (mDP)UPDATE 2016-9-12I just wanted to say that after six months, this monitor began to have a problem with flickering so I RMA'd it through ASUS.  When I got the monitor back from them, there were dozens of stuck pixels and the screen flickered multiple times every second or so.  So I sent it back to ASUS for a second time, and they sent me a new monitor that had clusters of dead pixels on the screen, so I sent it back to ASUS a third time, and after two weeks they send me an email saying they have a part shortage and no estimate for the repair.  They offered to send me the cheaper TFT version of this monitor instead - I find myself doubting that they lack the capability to send me a replacement monitor matching the model I actually bought in the first place.

"69","My eyes aren't what they used to be and when my new employer gave me a laptop with a 12.1 inch screen, my 23.9 inch 1920x1080 monitor just didn't cut it for full size drawings (I'm a consulting engineer), word documents at 100% I found bothersome to read (I can see the pixels at that resolution when close enough to read or when wearing glasses), and when set for 125% I cannot see the whole page on a 23.9 (24) inch monitor.After looking at 27 inch monitors with 1920x1080 resolution I realized the difference between them and 24 inchers was that the pixel size is increased and I would have an even more difficult time seeing at a working distance so my research led me to this Asus.  It's the same resolution as the Apple Thunderbolt with 2560x1440 resolution, $400 less (on Amazon) and has multiple inputs of various flavors. I decided to take advantage of the DisplayPort and the high resolution output of my laptop and haven't looked back.  I did have to adjust the display/text sizes in Windows for my taste, and I highly recommend using the ClearType setup for text.I can put up a full size drawing at full screen size and make out much more detail, many times I don't have to zoom in; word processing documents at 100% or 120% are easy on the eyes and there is so much more real estate on the screen that I don't feel a need for a second one (though I do use the laptop on occasion as the second monitor).  Word documents side by side at full size or larger look great, and at a proper seating distance of arm's length I cannot see the pixels.  I can sit in from of this monitor all day and not feel fatigued.I use the built in speakers with audio supplied via the DisplayPort cable and the sound is fine, not audiophile quality but decent, the speakers fire toward the rear; my monitor is 8 inches from a wall so it reflects the sound.I've done some CAD work and rendering; the lines and graphics are sooo much smoother, and photos, while not my main use for the monitor, look fantastic.  And if I had a better graphics card I can only imagine how even much better things would look.

After using dual 23"" HD monitors for two years, I was fed up and replaced one of them with this monitor.The Asus PB278Q is one of the best WQHD monitors you can get right now (05/01/2013) for the money. I'll leave the commentary on colors and calibration to the graphics pros and touch upon some other aspects of this product in this review.** PROS **- Perfect amount of anti-glare coating. We have Dell 27"" WQHD monitors on our campus workstations and they anti-glare matte coating on their screens are very dominant. The colors appear washed out and you can never turn the contrast high enough. Not pleasant to work on. Asus gets it perfect.- A lot of people reported major quality-control issues (backlight bleed, dead pixels, etc) for the batch manufactured in Q4 of 2012. Asus must have gotten their act together because the monitor I received has absolutely zero PLS glow and I can't spot a single dead pixel. Color me impressed.- Asus includes every cable you could possibly need with this monitor. This is a huge plus. A lot of competing WQHD monitors don't come with this wide a selection.- Height, swivel and tilt adjustments are easy and smooth. There's no forcing. The weight of the monitor is balanced very well against a spring-loaded system. Adjusting monitor position is effortless. This is also where you get a feel for how good the build quality is on this monitor. Once again, very impressed.** CONS **- Hardly a nuisance but if you're a gamer, you will want to cap your frame rates to 60. Unlike smaller monitors, this Asus does not have a 120Hz refresh rate option and if you leave V-Sync disabled and uncap your fps, you might experience a little tearing or ghosting.- The built-in speakers leave a lot to be desired, but I don't hold this against Asus. This is a monitor. Not a sound system.** OVERALL **Buy it. Period. The comparably priced Dell and LG monitors aren't nearly as good as this product. The robust Asus warranty and the fantastic build quality make it worth your money to jump up one tier from the budget Korean WQHD monitors.",9,28,19,37,75.6756756756757,24.3243243243243,"   dont deal  graphics  whole lot  im  researcher   field  computational simulationsnumerical analysis  work involves long hours  coding  simultaneously referencing numerous published material   type  work    rapidly consumes  available screen realestate    wqhd monitors   beloved among   people  work   using dual  hd monitors  two years   fed   replaced one     monitorthe asus pbq  one   best wqhd monitors  can get right now    money ill leave  commentary  colors  calibration   graphics pros  touch upon   aspects   product   review pros  perfect amount  antiglare coating   dell  wqhd monitors   campus workstations   antiglare matte coating   screens   dominant  colors appear washed    can never turn  contrast high enough  pleasant  work  asus gets  perfect  lot  people reported major qualitycontrol issues backlight bleed dead pixels etc   batch manufactured  q   asus must  gotten  act together   monitor  received  absolutely zero pls glow   cant spot  single dead pixel color  impressed asus includes every cable   possibly need   monitor    huge plus  lot  competing wqhd monitors dont come   wide  selection height swivel  tilt adjustments  easy  smooth theres  forcing  weight   monitor  balanced  well   springloaded system adjusting monitor position  effortless   also   get  feel   good  build quality    monitor    impressed cons  hardly  nuisance   youre  gamer  will want  cap  frame rates   unlike smaller monitors  asus     hz refresh rate option    leave vsync disabled  uncap  fps  might experience  little tearing  ghosting  builtin speakers leave  lot   desired   dont hold   asus    monitor   sound system overall buy  period  comparably priced dell  lg monitors arent nearly  good   product  robust asus warranty   fantastic build quality make  worth  money  jump  one tier   budget korean wqhd monitors

"71","I really wanted to like this monitor. It reviewed well, especially for gamers looking for a monitor with solid color and low/moderate lag. Yet, it seems like either QC is really off, I happened to get the ""one bad unit""*, or review sites are not being thorough.Pros:+ Very nice stand, with greater height than the Dell U2713HM+ Attractive, understated design+ All cables included+ Overall the build quality feels good (although the unit is a bit on the heavy side)+ My unit came double boxedCons:- Lack of factory color calibration means lots of fiddling to get a good image. Also, the monitor is delivered at 97% brightness (ouch, break out the sunglasses).- Backlight bleed was horrible for my unit. Maybe the LED module in the upper right slipped(?!). That quadrant was so much worse than the others...and the other quadrants were not much better.- PWM dimming is used (and at relatively low frequency, as reported in TFT Central's review). Sensitive users may notice flicker. I did not, but I did notice noise. The amount that the PWM circuitry produces was enough to give me a headache. Screenshot of audio analyzer is posted in Customer Images. Perhaps some units do not have this issue, or users are not hearing it due to environment or hearing sensitivity. Those with sensitive hearing and eyesight should evaluate the monitor in person.- Why does ASUS continue to use Styrofoam packaging? The Dell US2713HM came with all paper based packaging.*apparently, ASUS has ongoing issues fighting noise in circuit design lately, because two recent motherboards had similar noise issues on output (even with an outboard USB sound card with balanced speaker feeds).Compared to the Dell U2713HM...there is little comparison. Color and black levels are so much better on the Dell. Also, the Dell unit occasionally can be had for $100 cheaper. The ASUS unit should be priced lower, or QC should be improved.[EDITS] formatting, clarification, added detail, and adjusted tone from feedback",15,17,2,32,53.125,46.875,"   really wanted  like  monitor  reviewed well especially  gamers looking   monitor  solid color  lowmoderate lag yet  seems like either qc  really   happened  get  one bad unit  review sites    thoroughpros  nice stand  greater height   dell uhm attractive understated design  cables included overall  build quality feels good although  unit   bit   heavy side  unit came double boxedcons lack  factory color calibration means lots  fiddling  get  good image also  monitor  delivered   brightness ouch break   sunglasses backlight bleed  horrible   unit maybe  led module   upper right slipped  quadrant   much worse   othersand   quadrants   much better pwm dimming  used   relatively low frequency  reported  tft centrals review sensitive users may notice flicker       notice noise  amount   pwm circuitry produces  enough  give   headache screenshot  audio analyzer  posted  customer images perhaps  units     issue  users   hearing  due  environment  hearing sensitivity   sensitive hearing  eyesight  evaluate  monitor  person   asus continue  use styrofoam packaging  dell ushm came   paper based packagingapparently asus  ongoing issues fighting noise  circuit design lately  two recent motherboards  similar noise issues  output even   outboard usb sound card  balanced speaker feedscompared   dell uhmthere  little comparison color  black levels   much better   dell also  dell unit occasionally can     cheaper  asus unit   priced lower  qc   improvededits formatting clarification added detail  adjusted tone  feedback

"72","I usually don't do this kind of thing. For about 2 months this monitor was good working at full resolution, but then I started getting flickering. I was connected to my Macbook pro retina 2012 via mini-display port to display port. I bought and tried different cables but got the same behavior. Eventually the display port just stopped working. I contacted Asus via support (It's still under warranty) they were cordial and arranged an RMA right away. After several days of waiting I got the monitor back in worse condition than what I sent in. There were scratches all over the place, the bezel was completely not installed correctly and worse of all the monitor no longer powered up. So I basically have a dead monitor sitting in a box in my office. After opening up a case number along with my RMA, and sending pictures and uploading pictures to different departments I have been 17 days (and counting) without a monitor not including the time it took to get it fixed the first time and not counting the time the monitor was not working correctly and trying different options to make it work. After being on the phone with support about this case I am being told now I have to wait 15 more days for Asus and FedEx (avoid them too like the plague) to figure if I deserve an RMA and investigate what happened. Meanwhile I will be over a month without a working monitor and no replacement in sight. I have requested to get a replacement and was told that I have no option for a replacement or refund; I simply have to wait with a broken monitor packaged away in my office that I can't use on any level. With this new timeline I am looking at 2 1/2 months of just dealing with Asus, RMAs and their shipping department and longer if you include the time to try to remedy the issue with different cables.  At this point it is safe to assume Asus has lost a customer; I thought they were better than this. I am pretty sure some people love this monitor but when this monitor and Asus is bad, it is REALLY bad.  When it works this is a decent monitor but when it doesn't and you have to deal with support, watch out.

"74","1800 reviews of this monitor. What can I add to the mix? I love this monitor, it is a delight to work with, to play with. I am more than pleased. My one caveat is to get a decent display port cable. Yes, this unit comes with a full range of cables. I used the included display port cable and everything was fine for the first 6 weeks, lovely display. Then, I started to have problems: I use two monitorrs, one is a samsung connected to the HDMI port. No problems with that unit, but I started having difficulty when restarting oe restoring with the ASUS monitor. The computer didn't ""see"" the ASUS monitor; I could play with it and finally get the computer to use it as the primary display. Finally, this weekend, no joy for my new ASUS monitor. The connection at the monitor was secure, I tried using another one of the three display ports on my EVGA 970SSC card. Again, no success. I called EVGA, they told me this was a fairly common occurence with the cheap cable that ASUS shipped with their pricey monitor. I was just a little disappointed, to say the least. I ordered another display port cable (for $18) and expect this will fix my issues. So take my advice and save yourself some trouble, upgrade the cable when you purchase this monitor. You can find a list of approved cables at displayport.org.",8,11,3,19,57.8947368421053,42.1052631578947,"   reviews   monitor  can  add   mix  love  monitor    delight  work   play      pleased  one caveat   get  decent display port cable yes  unit comes   full range  cables  used  included display port cable  everything  fine   first  weeks lovely display   started   problems  use two monitorrs one   samsung connected   hdmi port  problems   unit   started  difficulty  restarting oe restoring   asus monitor  computer didnt see  asus monitor   play    finally get  computer  use    primary display finally  weekend  joy   new asus monitor  connection   monitor  secure  tried using another one   three display ports   evga ssc card   success  called evga  told     fairly common occurence   cheap cable  asus shipped   pricey monitor   just  little disappointed  say  least  ordered another display port cable    expect  will fix  issues  take  advice  save   trouble upgrade  cable   purchase  monitor  can find  list  approved cables  displayportorg

"75","The ASUS PB278Q is designed around the same plane-line switching (PLS) panel and screen technology as the Samsung SyncMaster S27A850T. It uses the same edge LED backlighting system and has the same tilt-swivel-rotate features on its height-adjustable stand.Connectors on the monitors lower back are restricted to audio- and video-only  theres no USB hub here like on the Samsung. DisplayPort, dual-link DVI, and HDMI are your choices for digital video, while VGA is a backup if needed. The monitor has an analog 3.5mm line input and a 3.5mm headphone jack.The PB278Q has an integrated 2x3W stereo speaker that works when either HDMI, the line-in, or DisplayPort is used. The volume can be easily controlled using a direct-access button on the monitors lower bezel, although we found it easier to leave it at full power and adjust volume within Windows.Setting up the PB278Q is simple. Screw the base of the stand into the stem with a single thumbscrew, rotate the entire stand from portrait to landscape, plug in the power and display cables, and youre ready to go.PROS:  - Great stand  - Great warranty from a well-known company. Warranty starts when the monitor was originally bought (if you buy used, or from a Like New Amazon Warehouse Deal).  - Less ghosting than the HP ZR2740w above due to newer technology and overdrive capabilities.CONS:  - Pricier, but not overly so like some of the $500+ 27 WQHD monitors available.  - Might be stuck around 60hz, uses PWM at 240hz, so may see some visible flicker at lower brightness levelsSummary:The ASUS PB278Q is a beautiful 1440p gaming monitor that suits the gamer who values image quality over response time and smoothness. I play RPG games and single-player adventure/action games such as Assassins Creed, Skyrim, and much more, where the surroundings and the color accuracy provides the most value to the gaming experience.However, the PB278Q will, of course, be able to play online shooting games like Counter-Strike for the average gamer but the more serious online shooting gamers would probably notice a lag as the response time, and refresh rate is slow compared to the TN panel based monitors.Nonetheless, the PB278Q looks good, performs great image quality and has a recommended resolution for gaming of any kind. Perfect for console gaming with its 60 Hz refresh rate, image quality and the two 3W speakers hidden instead of showing on the sides, or the audio line out on the monitor for your headphones.For now, I have it for two years already, and my next monitor will be 4k, but definitely from ASUS.",7,18,11,25,72,28,"   asus pbq  designed around   planeline switching pls panel  screen technology   samsung syncmaster sat  uses   edge led backlighting system     tiltswivelrotate features   heightadjustable standconnectors   monitors lower back  restricted  audio  videoonly  theres  usb hub  like   samsung displayport duallink dvi  hdmi   choices  digital video  vga   backup  needed  monitor   analog mm line input   mm headphone jackthe pbq   integrated xw stereo speaker  works  either hdmi  linein  displayport  used  volume can  easily controlled using  directaccess button   monitors lower bezel although  found  easier  leave   full power  adjust volume within windowssetting   pbq  simple screw  base   stand   stem   single thumbscrew rotate  entire stand  portrait  landscape plug   power  display cables  youre ready  gopros   great stand   great warranty   wellknown company warranty starts   monitor  originally bought   buy used    like new amazon warehouse deal   less ghosting   hp zrw  due  newer technology  overdrive capabilitiescons   pricier   overly  like      wqhd monitors available   might  stuck around hz uses pwm  hz  may see  visible flicker  lower brightness levelssummarythe asus pbq   beautiful p gaming monitor  suits  gamer  values image quality  response time  smoothness  play rpg games  singleplayer adventureaction games   assassins creed skyrim  much    surroundings   color accuracy provides   value   gaming experiencehowever  pbq will  course  able  play online shooting games like counterstrike   average gamer    serious online shooting gamers  probably notice  lag   response time  refresh rate  slow compared   tn panel based monitorsnonetheless  pbq looks good performs great image quality    recommended resolution  gaming   kind perfect  console gaming    hz refresh rate image quality   two w speakers hidden instead  showing   sides   audio line    monitor   headphonesfor now     two years already   next monitor will  k  definitely  asus

"78","UPDATE:Oh forgot to update. I got a new panel. This time it was double packaged (in Fedex box and then within that, the ASUS box). This one was definitely new. Keep in mind I ordered straight from Amazon both times.The second panel had, you guessed it, a dead pixel. I didn't mind it too much actually. The monitor OC'd to 75hz easily and the picture quality of movies were gorgeous because of the wider color gamut/saturation and the amazing contrast ratio. Honestly I really couldn't complain about the picture from my GTX 1070 through displayport.The reason I returned for good finally was that the input lag and ghosting is really bad. Asus claims 8 ms grey to grey, but even in game mode, I measured the lag in the high 20s, the ghosting didn't help either. I couldn't play anything too competitive. Also if hooked up my PS4 or PS3, and played a game or watched a movie, it didn't scale well. The picture was fullscreen but it looked really fuzzy and ""ghosty"" for lack of another word. I'm not sure if it was the VA panel or the anti -glare film they attach, but the picture again, looked ""ghosty"".Anyway I read numerous forums and all the amazon reviews. I didn't want to wait for the panel to develop new dead pixel and then Asus throw their nonsense 5 dead pixel limit needed requirement at me.My 2 cents, hoped it helped.Original Review:I just received this monitor and the first thing I did after reading all the complaints was to check for stuck pixels.  Lo and behold I found two instantly.  Then it dawned on me that the whole unboxing process felt a little weird.  All the cables seemed to have been in there, but there was no instruction booklet and nothing was neatly placed.To be honest, I think Asus is repacking units that were returned because they had stuck pixels and then telling the customer to shove off when they don't meet the ""3-5 stuck pixel policy.""I'm going to ask an RMA from Amazon.

"81","For those of you that have an Apple MacBook Pro and are looking for a large screen monitor to go along with it, you will need to be careful about choosing this monitor. The issues are not really with ASUS, they are more to do with limitations of earlier models of the MacBook Pro that I was not aware of until after I purchased this monitor.The first issue is that you need to have a minimum of the Late 2013 MacBook Pro in order to access the full spec of this monitor. The Late 2013, I believe, was the first MBP to come with Thunderbolt 2 ports. It also likely had a more robust GPU installed, both of which make a difference when you try running this monitor.I have an Mid 2012 MBP, the first Retina Display model. When I plugged the monitor into my MBP using a mini DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable, I found that I could not select 60Hz at 3840X2160 native resolution, even though it was using DP1.2. When I tried the scaling options in Display System preferences, it showed that 3840x2160 was only available in ""low resolution"" This was also the case in 2560x1600. There was another lower resolution and also a 1080p resolution that could be selected under OS-X, which had a 60Hz cycle and did not specifically say ""low resolution."" At that point, why did you get a 4K monitor in the first place.Another issue was that OS-X gave you no way to scale text. So you needed a magnifying glass at the native resolution to read the screen fonts that you couldn't zoom. Also the text was not crisp, no matter which settings on the monitor you set. This likely has to do with the graphics card that comes with pre-Late 2013 MBPs than the monitor itself, though to be honest, the text for the monitors native on screen display was more than a bit jagged, so I am not 100% sure of how this monitor renders text.The thing that ended up being an absolute deal breaker was what using the monitor through the Thunderbolt port did to download speeds. The first generation Thunderbolt port, which there are two on the MBP is not capable of pushing all the data to the monitor and also maintain any throughput using ethernet connected to the other Thunderbolt port. While I didn't run benchmarking tests, I can give you an anecdote. I was updating apps in iTunes while the monitor was connected and turned on. I looked at the download times and it said it would take 15 to 20 hours to complete the download. I have 25Mbps internet, so that seemed ridiculous. I paused the download and restarted it. Still the same thing. Then I turned off and disconnected the monitor and restarted the computer and download times went back to 6 minutes. I then tried connecting the monitor again and the download times skyrocketed back to many hours. When I turned off the monitor and unplugged the Mini DisplayPort cable the download times dropped back down to 5 to 6 minutes. So I am pretty sure that Apple did not build enough bandwidth into the early versions of Thunderbolt to handle high speed ethernet and Ultra High Definition displays running at the same time.These problems really are not ASUS fault and it seems to have much more to do with earlier versions of the MBP not having the horsepower for this monitor. I wasn't too impressed with the picture quality and text rendering from what I saw, but this could very well be an issue with the GPU in the MBP and not the monitor itself. It didn't seem like you could get very dark blacks on this monitor, but I am not sure how much of that was the monitor or the monitor and Mid-2012 MBP combination.So in summary, do not buy this, or likely any UHD monitor if you don't have a newer model MBP. That may answer the question of why Apple left their Thunderbolt Display unupgraded for several years. It was likely that the majority of the computers that they had couldn't handle the bandwidth needed to fully utilize a large screen, higher resolution monitor.",10,10,0,20,50,50,"         apple macbook pro   looking   large screen monitor  go along    will need   careful  choosing  monitor  issues   really  asus       limitations  earlier models   macbook pro     aware     purchased  monitorthe first issue    need    minimum   late  macbook pro  order  access  full spec   monitor  late   believe   first mbp  come  thunderbolt  ports  also likely    robust gpu installed    make  difference   try running  monitori   mid  mbp  first retina display model   plugged  monitor   mbp using  mini displayport  displayport cable  found     select hz  x native resolution even though   using dp   tried  scaling options  display system preferences  showed  x   available  low resolution   also  case  x   another lower resolution  also  p resolution    selected  osx    hz cycle    specifically say low resolution   point    get  k monitor   first placeanother issue   osx gave   way  scale text   needed  magnifying glass   native resolution  read  screen fonts   couldnt zoom also  text   crisp  matter  settings   monitor  set  likely      graphics card  comes  prelate  mbps   monitor  though   honest  text   monitors native  screen display     bit jagged      sure    monitor renders textthe thing  ended    absolute deal breaker   using  monitor   thunderbolt port   download speeds  first generation thunderbolt port    two   mbp   capable  pushing   data   monitor  also maintain  throughput using ethernet connected    thunderbolt port   didnt run benchmarking tests  can give   anecdote   updating apps  itunes   monitor  connected  turned   looked   download times   said   take    hours  complete  download   mbps internet   seemed ridiculous  paused  download  restarted  still   thing   turned   disconnected  monitor  restarted  computer  download times went back   minutes   tried connecting  monitor    download times skyrocketed back  many hours   turned   monitor  unplugged  mini displayport cable  download times dropped back      minutes    pretty sure  apple   build enough bandwidth   early versions  thunderbolt  handle high speed ethernet  ultra high definition displays running    timethese problems really   asus fault   seems   much     earlier versions   mbp    horsepower   monitor  wasnt  impressed   picture quality  text rendering    saw     well   issue   gpu   mbp    monitor   didnt seem like   get  dark blacks   monitor     sure  much     monitor   monitor  mid mbp combinationso  summary   buy   likely  uhd monitor   dont   newer model mbp  may answer  question   apple left  thunderbolt display unupgraded  several years   likely   majority   computers    couldnt handle  bandwidth needed  fully utilize  large screen higher resolution monitor

"84","I have been using this monitor for several months now. I also own the Samsung 28 inch 4k monitor. They are mostly the same when it comes to picture quality, but the ASUS has a much better stand. I was not going to write a review on this monitor, but I have had a small issue with these new 4k monitors. Which I will explain at the end of this review.Pros:Great color for a TN panelDecent Viewing angles for a TN panelGreat pixel densityGood response times for gamesLarge size, if you are into that sort of thingBest stand and frame out of all the 28 inch 4k panelsCons:Buttons on the back of the panel make it difficult to make adjustmentsDifficult to run high end games, I use 2 780ti's in SLI to achieve decent frame ratesWindows scaling is not the best, but it is better than nothing at all..and now my biggest complaint. You cannot use a DP cable that is longer than about 3 feet. I was using a high quality 10 foot cable for a while and I would always getting flickering and an odd popping noise from the monitor. I had the same problem with a 6 foot cable. I learned that 4k at 60 hz pushes the limits of DP cables. I tried running the monitor at 50 hz, but it only made it slightly better. Once I switched to a 3 foot cable the problem went away. Hopefully the next generation of 4k monitors and GPU's will use HDMI 2.0 and this problem will go away. That or display port will get an upgrade. Its a minor issue that actually is quite annoying to me since I like longer cables that allow better placement. Other than that the monitor works great.

"86","I have had this monitor for less than a month. Today I discovered that the button on the underside of the monitor that controls the brightness and provides navigation through the on screen menu is dead. It is simply unresponsive no matter what I try. It was working previously. This is supposed to be one of the best monitors that Asus makes and it is unacceptable that it would have this type of failure after less than four weeks of use.  Luckily Amazon's customer service is great and they are sending me a replacement. I will once again roll the dice and hope that I get a monitor that does not have defects. I was so happy that this one did not have dead pixels, but of course, something had to go wrong and a dead button was revealed to be the hidden flaw. I'm really looking forward to seeing what failure the replacement will have.  If you have purchased one of these monitors, you might want to check that all of the buttons are still working. They seem to fail suddenly and randomly. If you are thinking about purchasing one of these monitors, understand that buying an Asus product is a lot like walking through a minefield. You never know how things are going to turn out.UPDATE: Just received the replacement monitor. There is a dark gray spot right in the center of the screen which is very visible on lite colored backgrounds. Tried cleaning the screen but it appears to be under the surface. It's either a small clump of dead pixels or some dust behind the screen. I simply can't believe this! Back it goes for a refund.

"87","For the past 3 years I have been using a 27"" 1920x1080 Asus monitor for my PTC Creo CAD work.  I like the size of that monitor, but being that it's a TN panel I find it to be fatiguing after a long day.  My experience with IPS displays in several of my Chromebooks (HP Chromebook 11, Toshiba Chromebook 2, and a Pixel) made me realize how much easier it is to look at these IPS/PLS displays for extended periods of time.  When I saw that the price of this monitor had dropped to the mid $400's I snapped one up.  I connected this Asus to my Nvidia Quadro 5000 via Display Port, and it looks and works great for me.  For my CAD work everything looks great, and I find that I feel much better after a long day of looking at this screen that I had with my old monitor.  I was a bit concerned that the Creo text and icons would be too small, but things look really good (albeit smaller), and I actually like that I can have more icons and tree items visible without having to expand menus or scroll the tree.  I like all of the connectivity options, and the fact that all of the various cables were included.  I like having the ability to adjust the height, which I couldn't do with my old Asus.  And, the cheap built-in speakers actually sound okay (for system sounds).  I really like that the bezel around the screen is a matte finish, because the glossy bezel of my old monitor always showed the reflection of the lights in the ceiling (very annoying).  The non-glare coating (as opposed to a true matte screen) also works well.The only issue I have run into is a single stuck (on red) pixel.  I hoped it might un-stick itself after a couple of long days, but unfortunately, it hasn't.  I wouldn't fret too much about a single pixel if it were in one of the corners, but this one is near the center of the screen right in line with my left eye.  Even with it's tiny size, I am constantly aware of this pixel; especially with the light background of Creo's main window.  It has just been too distracting for me, so I decided to do a return and see what happens.  But, I still love this monitor and I'm hoping for the best with the new one.  It actually amazes me that you can have nearly 3.7 million pixels on a panel and only have 1 bad one, but it's also crazy how much that 1 tiny pixel can stand out when it's right in the middle of the screen.For my specific needs this is a great monitor, and I'm hoping to get many years of service from it.  If anyone has any ""Creo specific"" questions about this monitor, I'd be happy to answer as best I can.I'll be sure to update this review when I get the replacement monitor.I received my replacement monitor, and it also had a single goofy pixel in almost the same area as the original.  However, this one only shows up against a black background.  Since I never really work with a black background, I decided I'd keep it rather than continuing to mess around with doing exchanges.  Another thing I have noticed, now that I have been using my replacement for a few days, is that the fan on my first unit was seriously loud.  This new one is much quieter, and the monitor also seems to run cooler.  I even did a test where I cranked up the heat in my office, and while the fan was audible, it was not loud at all; even in a pretty hot environment.",16,27,11,43,62.7906976744186,37.2093023255814,"    past  years    using   x asus monitor   ptc creo cad work   like  size   monitor      tn panel  find    fatiguing   long day   experience  ips displays  several   chromebooks hp chromebook  toshiba chromebook    pixel made  realize  much easier    look   ipspls displays  extended periods  time    saw   price   monitor  dropped   mid s  snapped one    connected  asus   nvidia quadro  via display port   looks  works great      cad work everything looks great   find   feel much better   long day  looking   screen      old monitor     bit concerned   creo text  icons    small  things look really good albeit smaller   actually like   can   icons  tree items visible without   expand menus  scroll  tree   like    connectivity options   fact     various cables  included   like   ability  adjust  height   couldnt    old asus    cheap builtin speakers actually sound okay  system sounds   really like   bezel around  screen   matte finish   glossy bezel   old monitor always showed  reflection   lights   ceiling  annoying   nonglare coating  opposed   true matte screen also works wellthe  issue   run    single stuck  red pixel   hoped  might unstick    couple  long days  unfortunately  hasnt   wouldnt fret  much   single pixel     one   corners   one  near  center   screen right  line   left eye  even   tiny size   constantly aware   pixel especially   light background  creos main window    just   distracting     decided    return  see  happens    still love  monitor  im hoping   best   new one   actually amazes    can  nearly  million pixels   panel     bad one   also crazy  much   tiny pixel can stand    right   middle   screenfor  specific needs    great monitor  im hoping  get many years  service     anyone   creo specific questions   monitor id  happy  answer  best  canill  sure  update  review   get  replacement monitori received  replacement monitor   also   single goofy pixel  almost   area   original  however  one  shows    black background  since  never really work   black background  decided id keep  rather  continuing  mess around   exchanges  another thing   noticed now     using  replacement    days    fan   first unit  seriously loud   new one  much quieter   monitor also seems  run cooler   even   test   cranked   heat   office    fan  audible    loud   even   pretty hot environment

"92","I bought 2 of these monitors mainly because I wanted all my monitors that I have hooked up  to my iMac having the same 2560x1440 resolution.  This was super important to me.  I did lots of research on monitors and what to buy and which ones had 2560x1440 resolution. I found the Asus PB278Q 27 inch fit my requirements quite nicely so I ordered 2 of them.  What I love about them most is the resolution of course, but not only that, the monitor has so many options such as Portrait Mode (the monitor can flip sideways for spreadsheets). The height of the monitor is fully adjustable with quite a large range.  I have one of my monitors (the Middle one) sitting on a power supply switch box so it would normally be higher than the others but with this built in adjustment it worked out perfectly.  All the external monitors along with my 27 inch iMac are are the same level exactly. The flexibility of this monitor is just awesome. The colors and clarity  of the screen is super bright, and crisp. If I could rate it a 10 I would.  As far as external monitors to get, this is the one to own.  Sure its a bit expensive, but amazon does offer a considerable discount making it only cost me $469.99 per monitor instead of $700.00 each.  There are so many options on how to connect the monitor to your computer.  Since I have a iMac, it was a challenge for me to be able to hook up two monitors to my iMac.  I did it through the Thunderport input, using a optional 6 ft Cable ($9.99)  that I bought off amazon at same time I bought the monitor.I bought 2 of these cable to hook up from the monitors display port and the other end of the cable hooks up to my Thunderport ports in the back of my iMac.  I had the option of using either the DVI which i could have used I suppose but would have needed to buy a cable adapter for the TB port, so I felt the cable from amazon would work better in my case.  There were options as well to hook up via HDMI or Analog if one choose to use that, Personally I would not. This monitor does has speakers but I was not interested in the speakers as I have surround sound hooked up to my iMac already so I turned the sound option off on these monitors.  The speakers were not that great and I did not buy them for the sound but rather the picture quality and resolution.  It has easy to press physical buttons on the bottom of the monitor and the reason I like physical buttons is you know when you press them rather than the ones on other monitors that are touch sensitive and sometimes on those models you can't tell when you press them or not. You will know if you press these buttons on this monitor.All I can say is you will love the look and feel of this monitor.  You will definitely get your money's worth if you buy this monitor. Are there any Con's to this monitor?  Well if I had to nick-pick  it would have to be the speakers are not as good as the standard iMac's speakers but that does not apply to me since I have surround sound on my system, though iMac speakers sounds great.  These monitor speakers are not that great. If you have any questions on this monitor, please feel free to ask here on amazon.

"93","The Asus PB278Q is Incredible, period. We also have a PB287Q, which is 4k 28"" (paid $650 in Aug 2014), but that one is just too small of a screen for regular use at 4k. This 27"" beauty has a better panel, is a more reasonable resolution for a 27"" screen, and is a better price point ($450 in Aug 2014). If you are doing detailed image work, get the PB287Q 28"" 4k monitor, otherwise, for almost any other reason, including gaming, get the PB278Q 27"" 2560x1440 monitor. The pixel density is adequate enough, it is more likely that your video card can handle a 2560x1440 resolution, and you won't strain your eyes to see content in programs that don't scale.The internal speakers are not great, not even good, but its nice to have the option to use them.  If you decide to use Picture In Picture, such as running a TV signal into the monitor, then you can output the sound from the TV signal through the monitor speakers, while your PC audio comes through your regular PC speakers.The buttons on the PB278Q (this monitor) are far easier to access and use then the PB287Q. On this monitor, they are on the bottom of the screen, on the PB287Q, they are on the back.Both monitors come with excellent stands, but to do a full rotation from portrait to landscape you have to remove the base... which is a pain, and you won't want to do it regularly.  Fortunately, the single thumb screw is easy to operate.No need to buy any cables, ours came with one of each kind (hdmi, dp, vga, dvi) in standard 6 foot lengths.Bezel is still a bit thick, but it is a matte finish, so no annoying reflection.The monitor stand base has a 360 degree rotation disc, that seems like it would make it very easy to rotate your monitor... but from our experience, just feels like a gimmick, doesn't help much, overall probably a moot point.",6,18,12,24,75,25,"   asus pbq  incredible period  also   pbq   k  paid   aug    one  just  small   screen  regular use  k   beauty   better panel    reasonable resolution    screen    better price point   aug      detailed image work get  pbq  k monitor otherwise  almost   reason including gaming get  pbq  x monitor  pixel density  adequate enough    likely   video card can handle  x resolution   wont strain  eyes  see content  programs  dont scalethe internal speakers   great  even good   nice    option  use     decide  use picture  picture   running  tv signal   monitor   can output  sound   tv signal   monitor speakers   pc audio comes   regular pc speakersthe buttons   pbq  monitor  far easier  access  use   pbq   monitor     bottom   screen   pbq     backboth monitors come  excellent stands     full rotation  portrait  landscape    remove  base    pain   wont want    regularly  fortunately  single thumb screw  easy  operateno need  buy  cables  came  one   kind hdmi dp vga dvi  standard  foot lengthsbezel  still  bit thick     matte finish   annoying reflectionthe monitor stand base    degree rotation disc  seems like   make   easy  rotate  monitor    experience just feels like  gimmick doesnt help much overall probably  moot point

"99","I won't take you on the incredibly lengthy journey I went on by searching for a ""photo editor's monitor"" at a budget price. My absolute max budget was $300, but I really wanted to be closer to $200 if I could do it. While I would love to own a 16 bit monitor, I was well aware that wasn't going to happen at the $2000+ price tag. At the same token though, I needed something that was color and print accurate so I could edit with confidence that my prints would look like what I was viewing on my screen.This monitor is fantastic - the contrast and viewing angles are great and the accuracy is really quite amazing at this price range. I recently edited about 50 photos for print from a recent shoot I did, picked up the prints and then compared them with the on-screen images. In sRGB mode, I felt like the colors were spot-on and the final prints mirrored what I saw on my screen. The screen is a bit too bright, compared to the prints - but not bad. In other words, the screen can give the illusion of a well-exposed image (because it's too bright) when in fact, I need to bump the exposure on the photo another 1/3 to 1/2 stop. So for future edits, I know that what looks pretty bright on screen is actually a bit dim in print - and I need to increase the exposure a bit more. That's an easy fix - either through calibration or through manually adjusting the photos.I should also note that I'm 6'5"" and finding a monitor that adjusts well to my poster is hard - I often set books or get stands to elevate the monitor a bit. Not with this one! It has an incredible range of adjustments to practically an position you could want. All in all, I feel like this monitor was an absolute steal at this price! I can edit in confidence, knowing that the colors and contrast I see on screen mirror the printer's output... and for $200, that's not too shabby at all.If you're thinking about buying a monitor and want to keep it in the $200 range, stop thinking.

"100","Great monitor for gaming.  I got a great deal from Amazon Warehouse (have consistently had luck buying from them).  The monitor came well packaged, but with a generic displayport cable that didn't work to get 4K@60hz.  I suggest checking out displayport.org as there is a lot of great info there and recommended cables to use.  Even with having to buy a new cable i saved about $100 which is amazing for a 4k monitor.  Was hard to justify a $350 step up to the Asus ROG monitor, as much as that one is interesting and has a lot of cool features.  Once the price drops on those, may be interesting to compare.Back to the monitor - this will will be used 90% for gaming.  I have it paired up with a pair of 980s in SLI.  Everything is crisp and clear.  Colors seem to be very adjustable, but for me i just put it in game mode and left it there.

"105","I use this monitor for photo editing.  The picture quality and color balance both look good - while it works.My first monitor developed a problem after about 6 months.  It reached the point where it would only recognize the HDMI signal after multiple resets.  All of the other inputs seemed to work correctly.  (Tested with multiple computers and multiple cables.)I contacted Asus support and spent 15 minutes going through the usual scripted questions.  At the end of that the HD technician said that I should send the monitor in and they'd send out a replacement.  Since I didn't have the original box to ship it in, I pointed out that this monitor includes their  ""VIP"" support which includes advance shipment.  The tech stated that that only applies if they have one available (not what it says in the docs) and that he would check on it.  He put me on ""hold"" - which is to say he terminated my call.I called back and got a different tech.  Went through the same process, got the same disclaimer.  This time he put me on hold to check and see if there was a monitor available for advance replacement.  10 minutes later he came back and said that there was not a monitor available.I asked to speak to a supervisor.  About 15 minutes later he came back and said that there was still no supervisor available but that they had found a monitor to ship me.  After I provided my info again, he arranged shipment (though they put a hold on my credit card equal to the retail price of the monitor).The monitor showed up promptly with return shipping (prepaid) provided. (They did promptly release the hold on my CC when they received the faulty monitor.)About 3 hours after I plugged in the replacement monitor I heard a fairly loud ""pop"" from the back left side of the monitor.  The screen went blank and then returned a few seconds later.  Since that time, I've used the monitor for 30-40 hours without issues.

"109","I bought 3 of these for my workstation. The one question I get asked about these is about them being TN instead of IPS. To be honest, they're mostly stationary on my desk (they're on arms so I can move them but usually I don't). I'm always viewing them from the same angle, so I don't notice at all. They look fantastic.I'm running Fedora 22 and with the included cables they were detected out of the box and running at 3840x2160 @ 60 Hz.Very fast response time (benefit of TN). I was considering a couple of the Samsung TN displays as well but this one was less expensive and had a VESA mount while the Samsung models didn't. That was a deal breaker for me with the Samsung's. I'm glad I went with this monitor.These were an upgrade for me from three 28"" 1920x1200 displays. I'm amazed, I love 4k. I'm not scaling it at all and even though I don't have the best vision I can read almost everything. It took me a few hours to get used to it, but now I can read almost everything without increasing any DPI settings.I'm also not an artist, so most colors look the same to me anyways, but it seems like they do a great job of representing colors. I'm very happy with them, and I think most users who aren't professional art designers would be as well.I'm an engineer and I do CAD work and programming primarily with these. It's amazing how much more space I have to work with at 4k and how much more I can get done by not having to ration space that I can see.

"110","Not Happy at all. I own this monitor since February 8, 2015 today is December 9, 2015. In last couple months I started to have dead pixels all over the screen. I end it up with about 60 - 70 dead pixels especially on the right side of the screen.I contacted the support service (email only, no phone support available!) with my problem and after few email I received my RMA number. Unfortunately if you have only one monitor you are screwed. You can go and buy replacement or if you have a good friend you can borrow a monitor (good luck with that), otherwise you wont be able to use your computer for about 2 weeks. Nice!So I send it to them, 2second day delivery in ORIGINAL box the monitor came in (cost me $65, nonrefundable) and they got it. No email from them that they have it and working on fixing the problem. I waited 5 days and finally send them email and asked whats going on, and the reply with shipping information. BTW it takes always 24 hours for any reply from them!.Anyway I got it back after 5 days of shipping (something what should have been overnight-ed or second day shipping!) It came in different BOX! So I don't have my original box anymore! Looks like the monitor is fixed and its working as it should BUT the sides and top of my monitor are scratched up now from their rapier!So thank you ASUS you have fixed my monitor and in process you have lost my original box, damaged my monitor and reduced the resale value of my property.

"111","These displays are quite nice, colors look good and overall image quality is very nice. They also have a smaller bezel around the display which is nice. However ASUS doesn't seem to QC these panels very well. All of the displays which I have received, four as of writing this, two originally, have had some sort of defect. One of the first I ordered featured some dust and dirt with a bit of hair in between the panes. The replacement then had a grouping of dead pixels in the center of the display.

"112","I got this monitor because I was looking for a good value at this resolution level. Overall I would say it is a solid offering for the price. But there are a few things I am surprised to see in a nearly $400 purchase.When this item arrived, it was obvious that it was not new. On the unit there was a 2-3mm separation between the plastic of the front trim and the back of the unit, when every other corner of the monitor was sealed as expected with no gaps. To me it looked like the unit was dropped before. I was concerned this would lead to a backlight bleeding issue but haven't seen much bleeding so far.The HDMI cables in the box were indeed wrapped in plastic, but when I opened them, there were some dirty fingerprints on the metal parts of the connections. There were also fingerprints, smudges, and scratches on the back and front of the unit itself, even some scratches on the ASUS logo on the front. I could have bought this same item refurbished and saved $50, but I chose not to, since I heard about refurbished items having issues like this.

"113","This is an excellent and somewhat unique display, and it perfectly suits my needs, at least until OLED displays are common and affordable.My requirements for a display, in order:-- Not IPS (IPS glow reduces perceived contrast, and seems inherent to that panel type)-- Not TN (inherently poor contrast, generally less color depth, and bad off axis view)-- 2K 1440p resolution, not 4K (to avoid GPU upgrade from my 970)-- less than 100 ppi, as Windows scaling is atrociousCons:-- 2 dead pixels (99.9999457% of pixels work)-- Some minimal ghosting in darker scenes of games and movies, but only the keen-eyed 144Hz users will notice.Contrast is king; literally the single most important factor when it comes to image quality, not just in displays but in all imaging technology. Camera lenses are valued for the contrast of the photos they produce, and I have never once wanted to see LESS range between the lightest and darkest parts of a scene. Do yourself a favor and always demand the greatest (static) contrast ratio possible.Also, if you play games, get this version of the AU Optronics 32"" AMVA panel, as it is the only one that runs at 75Hz, unless the risk of a couple of dead pixels (or more and having to RMA) really are a deal breaker for you. If so, buy the BenQ and trade less pixel response and less contrast for those 2 pixels so you can claim that you have a ""pixel perfect"" display.",8,8,0,16,50,50,"     excellent  somewhat unique display   perfectly suits  needs  least  oled displays  common  affordablemy requirements   display  order  ips ips glow reduces perceived contrast  seems inherent   panel type  tn inherently poor contrast generally less color depth  bad  axis view k p resolution  k  avoid gpu upgrade    less   ppi  windows scaling  atrociouscons  dead pixels   pixels work  minimal ghosting  darker scenes  games  movies    keeneyed hz users will noticecontrast  king literally  single  important factor   comes  image quality  just  displays    imaging technology camera lenses  valued   contrast   photos  produce    never  wanted  see less range   lightest  darkest parts   scene    favor  always demand  greatest static contrast ratio possiblealso   play games get  version   au optronics  amva panel      one  runs  hz unless  risk   couple  dead pixels      rma really   deal breaker     buy  benq  trade less pixel response  less contrast    pixels   can claim     pixel perfect display

Amazon kindly refunded my money. Decided to buy a new one instead. That one has been working fine for close to a year now.To keep things looking the same. I ordered another one bit more than a month ago. It arrived, checked, everything great. First the monitor started turning off for less than a second randomly. Now it is also making a weird popping sound when it goes black. I don't know if it is serious or not. But it is causing me a lot of stress thinking than it will die soon. It's barely new and I don't have the box anymore. Even if I had it, I would have to deal with Asus directly and since I don't live in the states shipping this thing is REALLY expensive.I'm just writing this so people know that there is something wrong with the quality of Asus monitors in general. A friend of mine has my exact monitor and in his case the DP port stopped working. Also 2 other friends bought different versions and for 1 the monitor came with a lot of stuck pixels, had to return it to amazon and bought a new one with no problems for now.

"117","I wanted to pick up a decent, inexpensive 4k screen for my son's computer.  He's been fiddling with mods and textures on some games with a mid range video card (r9 270x) and a planar 1080p monitor.  Its his art.  But the video card and 1080p were holding him back...not enough vram, not enough pixels.I picked up an overclocked 970 which is a wonderful card.  We haven't tried it out on the very latest super high res games but he's running the batman series (including arkham knight), skyrim, etc.  Arkham Knight chokes a little at the higher resolutions with everything turned on but he's still getting ~35-50fps most of the time.  But AK is glitchy and slow on the PC, hopefully they'll fix that this fall.After looking at 3 dozen monitors I picked this one.  There are a few monitors that routinely garner editors choice awards and best inexpensive 4k screen, and this is either picked as the best or another screen that uses the same panel as this wins.  I'm not one of those guys that buys $5000 tv's and $2000 computer monitors, I just want it to look good, not have stuck pixels, and not be fussy or break down.Well, it looks great out of the box.  I haven't calibrated it yet and I might not bother.  It has a huge window right behind it and we're not seeing any issues with a washed out or ugly display when its backlit by the sunlight.  The stand is extremely flexible, allowing tilt, raise and lower without screws or a lot of work, just pushing it around.One gotcha is that the screen won't do 4k@60hz unless you use displayport and change a setting in the monitor to use DP 1.2.  The default settings with the included displayport cable came up at 30hz until I made the change.  Google it, there are some videos and text instructions on how to get into the monitor menus and flip it from DP 1.1 to 1.2.Anyhow, I was a little pensive about some of these cheap 4k displays and I'm sure the ones that roll out next year with IPS panels and better pulldown and all that other video nerd stuff will be better.  But we like it, the price was right, and unless it dies on me in <2 years I don't feel disappointed at all.I had looked at this and the samsung (which doesn't have as good of a stand), along with some super cheap no-names and ended up with this one for quality (some cheapos had reports of dirt between the screen and coating) and price...it was about $25 cheaper than the samsung when I bought it and both use the same panel.",12,23,11,35,65.7142857142857,34.2857142857143,"   wanted  pick   decent inexpensive k screen   sons computer  hes  fiddling  mods  textures   games   mid range video card r x   planar p monitor    art    video card  p  holding  backnot enough vram  enough pixelsi picked   overclocked     wonderful card   havent tried      latest super high res games  hes running  batman series including arkham knight skyrim etc  arkham knight chokes  little   higher resolutions  everything turned   hes still getting fps    time   ak  glitchy  slow   pc hopefully theyll fix   fallafter looking   dozen monitors  picked  one      monitors  routinely garner editors choice awards  best inexpensive k screen    either picked   best  another screen  uses   panel   wins  im  one   guys  buys  tvs   computer monitors  just want   look good   stuck pixels    fussy  break downwell  looks great    box   havent calibrated  yet   might  bother     huge window right behind     seeing  issues   washed   ugly display   backlit   sunlight   stand  extremely flexible allowing tilt raise  lower without screws   lot  work just pushing  aroundone gotcha    screen wont  khz unless  use displayport  change  setting   monitor  use dp    default settings   included displayport cable came   hz   made  change  google     videos  text instructions    get   monitor menus  flip   dp   anyhow    little pensive     cheap k displays  im sure  ones  roll  next year  ips panels  better pulldown     video nerd stuff will  better    like   price  right  unless  dies     years  dont feel disappointed  alli  looked     samsung  doesnt   good   stand along   super cheap nonames  ended    one  quality  cheapos  reports  dirt   screen  coating  priceit    cheaper   samsung   bought    use   panel

"120","Plug and Play, plain and simple. The Monitor wants to dominate your sound scheme from the start which is alright since you want to hear how the built in speakers work which is well. After I found that out I just went to sound properties in control panel and switched back to my 7.1 surround. The presets for different scenarios is quite handy, I use standard for watching tv else the flesh tones get too red on game mode or scenery mode. That takes a little playing with. No dead or bright pixels like some have said, not a blemish anywhere. I freaked for a few minutes when my hookup of choice (Display Port 1.2) only had a regular to regular cable when I needed regular to mini, but alas, I found an adapter that came with my Radeon 7950 so I was good to go. 2560x1440 was no question, just incredible! I needed more real estate for video/audio editing and photography and it gave me that compared to my ten year old 24"" 1920x1200. It shows me what my photos really look like, and showing before and after shots side by side is invaluable. I have not even tried to dabble with the sRGB mode yet, I'm just thrilled to not have Photoshop tell me that my monitor is not calibrated properly! One person was right about brightness, it comes out of the box at full brightness, I backed it down by 25%. Contrast is excellent but you may have to up the gamma in games. It was fun to have to go into video options in all my games to up the resolution to 2560x1440! And then to experience the difference in those high-end games just blows my mind! I much prefer 16:9 format rather than 16:10 on my old monitor. I give it 10 stars.

"121","I ordered the ASUS PB278Q for home because I had been using one at work and was impressed by the picture quality.  A couple of weeks after using the new monitor at home, I noticed that on occasion, the monitor would make an audible 'snap' sound and the picture would flash or go blank for two or three seconds, then come back.  When using for long periods of time, I noticed that the 'snap' would occur every two or three hours.I returned the monitor and received a replacement.  After using the replacement monitor for a while, noticed that it had the same problem.  I didn't immediately request to return the second monitor, and now I'm past the 30 days from when the original was shipped.

"122","I ordered the ASUS PB287Q and when it arrived, I noticed a dead pixel in the bottom corner. Unhappy I submitted a replacement order and was pleased to receive a replacement panel very quickly - though to no avail. Once again there was a stuck blue pixel in the top left portion of the screen as well as having an almost hazy appearance. Frustrated I ordered another replacement, and called Amazon now that I was going to submit a replacement of a replacement. I was reassured that the process would proceed smoothly. When I received my third monitor, there once again were dead pixels to greet me. I requested a refund, which did not process until after delivery plus 4-5 days. All the while I was using a 1080p monitor on a GTX 1080. Thank God for Amazon's replacement/return process, I can only imagine how much worse and drawn out this could have been.

"125","I want to get straight to the point. The displayport problems are so annoying and frustrating, that I may just send this back and get a different monitor. I liked the idea of having an HDMI and DP monitor because that meant I could plug in my PC and my PS3/4 at the same time! Seemed simple in theory. The HDMI works perfectly! I have not yet found a single problem with HDMI. But the DP just REFUSES to work! I searched the internet for answers, and everyone said to just unplug the monitor and plug it back in. No dice. The next logical conclusion was to find the correct drivers. Well that makes sense, I thought. No dice. After contemplating throwing the monitor at a wall, I tried just one more reboot. And it freaking worked out of nowhere! As of yet I have no single idea why it has worked, and I'm far too afraid that if I turn off the computer it wont work again.+ 2560x1440 looks really nice with my HDMI- Displayport problems are a belt sander to my scrotumBuy at your own risk.

"126","Received this monitor from Amazon Warehouse Deals (Prime delivery included) as in ""very good"" condition with mostly notes about packing materials and boxing being damaged.  As far as I could tell, that was it--the actual monitor and parts were all as new--no cosmetic damage anywhere even on the screen (which did not have the usual removable protective film present).  Speaks highly of Amazon's internal processes dictating customer satisfaction.Initial set-up was simple and did not require any instructions. The rear panel connections are oddly positioned under a plastic piece that should come off but apparently does not--requiring you to navigate your cords with a flashlight, sight, and touch (most conveniently this odd piece of plastic  should flip up or simply not be there in the first place).  Once connected, the actual hold is sufficient--cords are going to stay in place.  Connecting the monitor via Display Port 1.2 (HDMI and DP cords both provided) to a single Nvidia GTX970 graphics card was simple. The power cord was shorter than my prior Asus monitor and as such would not reach my UPC power back-up on the floor.  Just another foot would have done it--however since this cord is standard--just using my old cord works fine.Turning it on and adjusting the resolution was simple via personalization and/or Windows 8.1 control panel. There was no need to look at the Nvidia control panel but for a verification that the proper connections had been made and that it was truly running at 60 Hz (which it was, plug and play except for screen resolution).  Then there was the matter of making icons bigger and getting the text leveled out for old eyes.  Control panel made quick work of the icons (had to set at 125% for me), and the Windows true text setting needed some adjustment--even then it took some time to get used to the way text is displayed.  It is different from my 1080 display.  Not liking the initial default screen settings I moved to ""game"" mode (with apparent increases in saturation and contrast).  Prior to testing a game, I made sure via the Nvidia control panel my drivers were up to date and games optimized.Nothing had changed for the game I was going to test -Borderlands 2--everything was still maxed out in 4K resolution.  Opening the game and changing the resolution to 4K showed gorgeous detail as expected.  Now Borderlands may not be the most graphic intensive game, but on previously used Nvidia GTX660, I did not like the performance with everything maxed out (some slow downs at times)--but with the newer Nvidia GTX970 I have run everything full tilt.  There were no perceivable changes in subjective frame rate playing Borderlands 2 maxed out at 4K resolution.  Stunning details and super clear.Nice adjustments on screen height and rotation are available... positive connections horizontal to vertical without being too hard (or too easy) to move about.  Up and down positioning was also straight forward.For the price (a tad over $500), via a Warehouse Deal, this monitor seems to me a great addition to my current set-up.  It is also encouraging me to jump for another GTX970 card just to see if any dramatic differences occur with SLI on any other games I may try.Four stars total: one star off of five for the shorter power cord and the odd piece of plastic requiring you to feel your way to connections.  Actual operation deserves a 5, so maybe 4.4 rounded down?I do love Asus, and this will be my third Asus monitor over the past decade--this pushes the really old (now third wheel) Dell of my desk to eBay!",7,17,10,24,70.8333333333333,29.1666666666667,"  received  monitor  amazon warehouse deals prime delivery included    good condition  mostly notes  packing materials  boxing  damaged   far    tell   itthe actual monitor  parts    newno cosmetic damage anywhere even   screen      usual removable protective film present  speaks highly  amazons internal processes dictating customer satisfactioninitial setup  simple    require  instructions  rear panel connections  oddly positioned   plastic piece   come   apparently  notrequiring   navigate  cords   flashlight sight  touch  conveniently  odd piece  plastic   flip   simply      first place   connected  actual hold  sufficientcords  going  stay  place  connecting  monitor via display port  hdmi  dp cords  provided   single nvidia gtx graphics card  simple  power cord  shorter   prior asus monitor      reach  upc power backup   floor  just another foot   done ithowever since  cord  standardjust using  old cord works fineturning    adjusting  resolution  simple via personalization andor windows  control panel    need  look   nvidia control panel    verification   proper connections   made     truly running   hz    plug  play except  screen resolution      matter  making icons bigger  getting  text leveled   old eyes  control panel made quick work   icons   set       windows true text setting needed  adjustmenteven   took  time  get used   way text  displayed    different    display   liking  initial default screen settings  moved  game mode  apparent increases  saturation  contrast  prior  testing  game  made sure via  nvidia control panel  drivers    date  games optimizednothing  changed   game   going  test borderlands everything  still maxed   k resolution  opening  game  changing  resolution  k showed gorgeous detail  expected  now borderlands may     graphic intensive game   previously used nvidia gtx    like  performance  everything maxed   slow downs  timesbut   newer nvidia gtx   run everything full tilt     perceivable changes  subjective frame rate playing borderlands  maxed   k resolution  stunning details  super clearnice adjustments  screen height  rotation  available positive connections horizontal  vertical without   hard   easy  move      positioning  also straight forwardfor  price  tad   via  warehouse deal  monitor seems    great addition   current setup    also encouraging   jump  another gtx card just  see   dramatic differences occur  sli    games  may tryfour stars total one star   five   shorter power cord   odd piece  plastic requiring   feel  way  connections  actual operation deserves    maybe  rounded downi  love asus   will   third asus monitor   past decadethis pushes  really old now third wheel dell   desk  ebay

"134","July 29, 2014: After owning this monitor for a week, it developed a 2 or 3 inch vertical black line as if it had dead pixels. Rebooting usually fixed the problem for a while. It turns out that the problem is related to its interaction with my graphics card. Rebooting was really annoying, but there was another solution. Right clicking on the screen brings up a menu that shows the resolution. There is an advanced settings tab that allows you to change the color rendition. Click the Monitor tab. Change the rendition from true color to high color, but do not accept the change after the graphics card switches. The black streak will be gone for quite a while. This process takes about 30 seconds and seems to last for at least a week or two. Other than this minor annoyance, my review below still stands. Perhaps with other graphics cards, this flaw does not appear. The resolution, clarity, and color rendition of this monitor are great for pictures, games, and work.June 21 2014: The ASUS PB27HQ is probably one of the best monitors you can purchase at a very reasonable price. The monitor arrived without any flaws. Of course, this is day one, so I have no comments on durability. It's a 16:9 ratio monitor (2560:1440), which I usually dislike. But this one has enough pixels in the vertical direction, 1440, so that I can display a full page of text or graphics, which helps getting work done. At the same time, I get extra width to display multiple windows side-by-side. Image quality and out of the box color adjustment are excellent. Viewing and editing photographs produces beautiful results, especially at the high WQHD resolution.  Photo-bugs may want to tune it slightly, but I intend to leave this one at factory settings. All possible cables are supplied, even ancient VGA. I used the HDMI with perfect results. Set up is trivial. 1) Fasten the base, 2) Attach the power cord, 3) Select and attach the video cable to the computer. 4) push the power button (lower right corner), and 5) Select connection using the button just to the left of the power switch.

"138","Occasionally, you come across a product that's so amazing that you just need to tell the world. That is how this monitor feels.It's the perfect size, it has great color, and it includes all the cables you could dream of. The monitor stand does not come preattached, but it attaches in an amazingly convenient way, and does not require any tools. The packaging is sturdy and it's got plenty of wiggle room, so damage during shipping should not be a concern. If you're looking for a large, high quality 1440p monitor then you don't really need to look much farther unless you want 21:9 or something curved.My only complaint would be that the speakers aren't very loud. They are loud enough, and they are decent quality, but no one really buys a monitor because they expect the speakers to be amazing. These are definitely good enough, but they probably earn about 7/10 points. My main gripe is that I really just wish they were louder.One selling point for me was also the 75Hz refresh rate, which was a very hard spec to track down.

"139","I originally wrote this as a five-star review just after receiving my monitor, with the caveat that it had one minor flaw - the right side was very slightly brighter than the rest of the panel, easiest to see on grey or white backgrounds (such as 99% of web sites). It took me several days to even notice this and initially I thought it was just me being super nitpicky, but staring at the thing every day for a couple of weeks, it ended up really bothering me. I couldn't stop looking at the right side of the screen and comparing it to the center or left. I returned that monitor thinking it was probably defective, but my replacement turned out to be exactly the same.The backlighting pattern is the same on both of my monitors: the left and center of the screen are equally bright and uniform. Then about 6 inches from the right edge on the bottom, there's a *dark* patch that happens to sit right in front of where the power cable plugs in - this monitor does have an internal power supply. Further to the right, the panel gets slightly but consistently brighter all the way to the edge, over about the last 5"" of the screen from top to bottom. I'm usually okay with some level of unevenness in monitor backlighting, but most monitors have a more symmetrical (or random) pattern. Having that one dark patch and then one side of the panel being brighter is distracting even though it's not a huge brightness difference.So why do I even give it four stars? Because otherwise, there is nothing I don't like about this monitor, and I think for most purposes, the uniformity wouldn't be an issue. An office worker isn't even going to care; and you can only really see it on light, solid backgrounds, so gamers, photographers or video editors wouldn't even notice it. And technically speaking, all LCD monitors have imperfect uniformity, many worse than this. It's also still a great deal at around $200. Even a few years ago, a 1080p, 23"" IPS monitor with build quality and features like this would have cost $1,000. Some of the specifically great things about it:* IPS panel - accurate, natural color and very little off-axis color shift* 6ms pixel response - that's good for an IPS panel and makes it suitable for gaming, not just photographic/video work* Pretty excellent build quality (notwithstanding my second unit's slightly imperfect bezel) - it's still plastic, but it's the thick stuff like PC manufacturers used to use; feels like you'd think an IBM would if they still made hardware* All the ports you'll ever need - VGA, DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort - this thing's both backward compatible and future-proof* Matte screen - in fact the whole monitor's matte, not a glossy surface to be found anywhere (yay!)* No ""graininess"" or ""sparkle"" - I've seen this on some matte screens, this one is super-clear* If you want them, speakers and a USB hub built in - the speakers are extremely well hidden if you have external ones* VGA, DVI, USB, audio and DisplayPort cables are all included - just no HDMI for some reason* Sturdy and versatile stand that tilts, swivels and doesn't wobbleTo expand on that last point a bit, I noticed in my searching that one big area that separates ""cheap"" monitors from more expensive ones is actually the stand. In a ~$200 monitor, you're lucky if you get so much as tilt, much less height or swivel adjustment, and reviewers always seem to complain about wobble, even just from typing. I've even seen people complain about their monitors being permanently off-axis from the factory, sitting slightly crooked on their non-adjustable stands, *and* wobbling when they type. No matter how good a monitor is otherwise, that would drive me nuts and would definitely make me return it.But this stand is amazing - it's a real selling point! Tilt, height adjustment, and swivel are all possible. It will even rotate the screen 90 degrees for portrait use - not many monitors at this price can do that! And it's chunky and solid - no wobble here. The only minor quibble is that it's a tiny bit ""front-heavy"" because the screen sits basically in line with the front edge of the stand, so if you bump into it from the back, it'd probably be pretty easy to knock it over (luckily I'm using it at home with a wall behind it). I'd have liked to see the front edge of the stand extended by about another inch, but that's really being nitpicky with a generally excellent stand.Lastly, some early reviewers of this monitor complained about crosshatching and light bleed - I'll just say that I see neither of these *at all*, and again, I am a tough crowd. I've looked for them. My first monitor was made in December of 2013 and the second in March of 2014, so if these really were problems at one point, they may have mainly affected earlier units. That's one of the benefits of buying a model that's a little bit older. (Of course, I've never read about uneven backlighting on the early units, so...)I did a lot of looking around and I still don't think there's a better monitor at this price. You can always spend $500 or more on a really high end, professional monitor that's pre-calibrated from the factory and will have really minimal uniformity problems, light bleed or other issues, plus an even better S-IPS or other kind of panel. But for those on a budget, this is a really good monitor as long as you're not particularly sensitive to screen uniformity issues.",33,46,13,79,58.2278481012658,41.7721518987342,"   originally wrote    fivestar review just  receiving  monitor   caveat    one minor flaw   right side   slightly brighter   rest   panel easiest  see  grey  white backgrounds     web sites  took  several days  even notice   initially  thought   just   super nitpicky  staring   thing every day   couple  weeks  ended  really bothering   couldnt stop looking   right side   screen  comparing    center  left  returned  monitor thinking   probably defective   replacement turned    exactly  samethe backlighting pattern        monitors  left  center   screen  equally bright  uniform    inches   right edge   bottom theres  dark patch  happens  sit right  front    power cable plugs    monitor    internal power supply    right  panel gets slightly  consistently brighter   way   edge    last    screen  top  bottom im usually okay   level  unevenness  monitor backlighting   monitors    symmetrical  random pattern   one dark patch   one side   panel  brighter  distracting even though    huge brightness differenceso    even give  four stars  otherwise   nothing  dont like   monitor   think   purposes  uniformity wouldnt   issue  office worker isnt even going  care   can  really see   light solid backgrounds  gamers photographers  video editors wouldnt even notice   technically speaking  lcd monitors  imperfect uniformity many worse    also still  great deal  around  even   years ago  p  ips monitor  build quality  features like    cost     specifically great things   ips panel  accurate natural color   little offaxis color shift ms pixel response  thats good   ips panel  makes  suitable  gaming  just photographicvideo work pretty excellent build quality notwithstanding  second units slightly imperfect bezel   still plastic    thick stuff like pc manufacturers used  use feels like youd think  ibm    still made hardware   ports youll ever need  vga dvi hdmi displayport   things  backward compatible  futureproof matte screen   fact  whole monitors matte   glossy surface   found anywhere yay  graininess  sparkle  ive seen    matte screens  one  superclear   want  speakers   usb hub built    speakers  extremely well hidden    external ones vga dvi usb audio  displayport cables   included  just  hdmi   reason sturdy  versatile stand  tilts swivels  doesnt wobbleto expand   last point  bit  noticed   searching  one big area  separates cheap monitors   expensive ones  actually  stand    monitor youre lucky   get  much  tilt much less height  swivel adjustment  reviewers always seem  complain  wobble even just  typing ive even seen people complain   monitors  permanently offaxis   factory sitting slightly crooked   nonadjustable stands  wobbling   type  matter  good  monitor  otherwise   drive  nuts   definitely make  return itbut  stand  amazing    real selling point tilt height adjustment  swivel   possible  will even rotate  screen  degrees  portrait use   many monitors   price can     chunky  solid   wobble    minor quibble     tiny bit frontheavy   screen sits basically  line   front edge   stand    bump     back itd probably  pretty easy  knock   luckily im using   home   wall behind  id  liked  see  front edge   stand extended   another inch  thats really  nitpicky   generally excellent standlastly  early reviewers   monitor complained  crosshatching  light bleed  ill just say   see neither          tough crowd ive looked    first monitor  made  december     second  march      really  problems  one point  may  mainly affected earlier units thats one   benefits  buying  model thats  little bit older  course ive never read  uneven backlighting   early units soi   lot  looking around   still dont think theres  better monitor   price  can always spend      really high end professional monitor thats precalibrated   factory  will  really minimal uniformity problems light bleed   issues plus  even better sips   kind  panel      budget    really good monitor  long  youre  particularly sensitive  screen uniformity issues

"141","Excellent monitor - in use as the main monitor in a digital music studio set up.  No complaints thus far.  I see none of the artifacts and other negative observations on other reviews.  I will attempt to use it for photo editing later in the year, and will update this review at that time.  The stand's positioning flexibility far exceeded my expectations.  I was concerned that this monitor had been around for 4 years and might be technologically obsolete, but it has turned out to be an awesome value.I have my Apple Mac Mini connected via DisplayPort, and a 2nd connection via HDMI to an HDMI Matrix splitter so I can watch cable, Apple TV, or blu-ray content.  The various color shadings available make this an awesome monitor to watch movies on, and I was not distracted by slow refreshes in action scenes.  It Is a good idea to walk through all the settings in the menu,  as you will find this monitor to be a step above both your TV and your typical PC monitor, in terms of flexibility.  Check VividPixel settings for pixel smoothing for example.  You can make the display as sharp or smooth as you need dependent on what you are doing with it.  I like choices, don't you?  There is even a calibration for gaming, where you can calibrate how the monitor tracks for 1st person shooters, I suspect.I am using the monitor with Apple Logic Pro X, which offers up a TON of data across multiple windows.  The additional screen real estate from running at a higher resolution is a gift.  I now no longer need two screens.

"142","This monitor started out pretty good, with good performance and image quality. Physically, I'm not in love with the design, but my complaints are minor and I was willing to overlook them.What makes this a 1 star review is the short duration in which the monitor functioned fully and the ASUS RMA process. Within a year, the DisplayPort input became flaky and eventually failed, requiring any DisplayPort devices to use an adapter with the DVI or HDMI inputs. Once I got around to starting the RMA for the monitor, I was displeased that there is no advance replacement option (even at my own cost) and that I was required to pay shipping to ASUS. Not cool.After waiting a couple weeks for the repairs to be completed and the monitor returned to me, I received it in the condition shown in the pictures. The  stand components were dismantled and put in the box without padding, causing pieces to snap off and the components to be marred. What's worse, the padded display component has the bezel all but falling off the monitor and as such I'm not even bothering to plug it in for fear of a short circuit, or worse, a fire.ASUS will *never* get my business again, and anyone I know will hear strong words from me encouraging them to take the same stance.

"144","The ASUS PB278Q is exactly the monitor I am looking for, and at a great value.  For up to now and for so long Apple held the best WQHD, or WQXGA, monitor for users that needed more than 1080p HD resolutions. However, the cost was well beyond what I would consider to spend.  There were very few other manufactures, as well, that I can find, that could not curb their cost as well. I do a LOT of graphic design work both in 3D and 2D areas, animation included. I needed a monitor that was more than the FHD(Full HD 1080p) that I was using now. I found it in this Monitor from ASUS.  It is everything it claims to be. The colors are brilliant, the picture is bright and clear, even sharp.  Though it has 5ms response, it has the some technology (Probably the SPLENDID) that works better for animations than my FHD monitors of other manufacturers, both less than 1 year old! On the Physical side, the monitor comes with some cable management, for you have 4 different input capabilities plus power.  The monitor can be physically turned from Landscape to Portrait. Cool feature but I think I will use it rarely, if any.

"145","This monitor is amazing. While it lacks USB through-ways I can live with it, as its performance on just about every other level is stellar. While the colors are a bit bright and not exactly providing the deepest black shading, the level of detail is superb.

The southern Indiana support people are nice, but nothing comes of it.-10/11, 2013.  First ASUS support contact was via on-line chat.  I was mis-advised what to do.  It turns out the monitor comes with a ""Rapid Replacement"" option and I assumed that was what was happening.  Wrong.- 10/22  Contacted ASUS live chat support again 10/22, had the RMA changed.  Told that they contact another part of the company for a replacement stock check and that I should get an e-mail within 2 days with the cross ship logistics.- 10/30  Called ASUS support since there had been no contact.  They hadn't gotten a response to the first stock check to ACI and he'll resend the stock check.  If they are out of the model I have I'll be offered another model.  I should get a response within a couple of days...- 11/1  Called ASUS support to follow-up since there had been no response.  If ACI doesn't have it then ""we go to sales"".  ""Wait until Monday or Tuesday"".-  11/6  Called ASUS support again.  No response from stock check, will resend and cc: management.-  11/7  Called ASUS support again.

"147","Phenomenal monitor for money! It was a steal at just $549. I went from a LG 23"" 1080p LED monitor to this 1440p monster and the difference is night and day. It is like putting on glasses for the fist time, or going from SD to HD TV. After comparing my old 1080p monitor to a Dell U2711 1440p at work, I realized the glory that is 1440p and just had to step up to a higher resolution.I have yet to do a side-by-side comparison of the ASUS PB278Q to the Dell UltraSharp U2711 (FYI/BTW, there is a new version - the Dell U2713HM availoable for around $800), but the ASUS seems to be as good as if not better than the U2711 in every area, especially in terms of text legibility. The ASUS provides sharp and clear text whereas the U2711 text is often blurry and difficult to read.This is a great monitor for just about any task. I use my PC for mundane things like web-browsing and word-processing to CPU-intensive tasks like gaming and geospatial analysis via ESRI ArcGIS. The extra screen real estate is great for essentially everything, especially Photoshop and Illustrator.Gaming at 1440p is fantastic! While it may not have the fastest response time (5ms is more than adequate), it is great for the casual gamer who does not need a monitor 120Hz refresh rate or a 1ms response time.

"149","as of 02/2016 this was the way to go for 4K for me.  I am doing photo editing so I need the extra resolution for pinpoint accuracy.  You get that. In the box is the power cable and an HDMI cable as well as a Display Port cable.  I NEEDED the Display port cable to get the 4K .  ONCE you can figure out how to set your video card, some smoke and mirrors, watch a few video tutorials, call ASUS who are about NO HELP at all!  Play around, study the internet and 7 hours later Whala! DisplayPort 3840 X 2160 @60 HZ.  (The obtaining the 60HZ was the hard part to get.)  ASUS Support on the internet gave me some clues but I found it not to be windows 10 friendly.  I called them and was on hold for over 45 minutes 3 times with no answer.  The first (Live Chat) Johnathan Ended the conversation soon as I typed out my problem.  Appilonia Only got me to the you need the Display port cable part and bailed out on me.  And after that They never answered the phone, Live chat or by e mail again.  I figured it out. (By accident so I can't even tell you how)  HOWEVER once it is set up.  What a pleasure to work Photo editing with.  The stand is incredible.  (As well as the picture and controls menu)  The stand allows you to lift the screen from 1.5 inches off the desk to almost 7.5 inches off the desk with ONE finger!  Once you get it up you can Rotate the screen from horizontal to vertical view!  This is GREAT for photo editing as you can look at pictures taken with the camera in a vertical orientation without compressing the photo.  Makes for easy editing.  And it's also a great feature to flip the screen this way for the 50 times you will be dealing with the cables while installing, or later on when you want to add or switch cables.  This articulation of the screen is a great feature and I might mention it tilts greatly in both vertical and horizontal. You can get the perfect height, angle and orientation with this display!  EASILY!  Paying over $400 i feel it was certainly worth the money, really wish ASUS was more supportive.

"154","Unless you have your displays side-by-side i.e. not tilted towards you whatsoever, viewing angle is a big deal. Fortunately, the PB278Q with its IPS tech supports wider viewing angles. I thought I screwed up the color profile on my second monitor but it was actually just the poor viewing angle. I already had one PB278Q so I got a second one to replace my viewing-angle-challenged 1920x1080 monitor.Things to consider:If you have poor vision and have not used a 2560x1440 27"" monitor in person, I would highly recommend doing so before purchasing one. The pixel density is relatively high (which is usually a good thing), but that also means the text will be smaller. Not all applications support text zooming adjustment gracefully and if your monitor is too far away you will be squinting to see what is easily visible with a smaller resolution/monitor. The Retina MacBook Pro has high pixel density but its default resolution is half (1440x900) of what the display supports (2880x1800) to improve readability. You can always opt to use a smaller resolution, but that kind of defeats the purpose of getting such a large/expensive monitor.Some displays do have a problem with certain images / color combinations on the screen where they will emit a high-frequency sound. I have had zero problems with PB278Q in this department. I thought I was going crazy until a friend of mine had the same problem and so I recommended this monitor to him, and he was happy to find it wasn't a universal problem. Both instances involved Dell monitors, but I assume it was an isolated problem with those two monitors or models.I haven't had any dead pixel problems with either monitor, but every manufacturer produces products with defects including ASUS. An ASUS laptop I bought about 6 years ago had a couple of dead pixels in the lower right-hand corner.

I went with the ASUS because other reviews said glare was not an issue and I agree with that.

Note that the Apple adapter is another $95.I would give this monitor 5 stars except for the setup difficulty and another glitch where the monitor will suddenly go black or snowy.

"158","I purchased this monitor by mistake, but since it has arrived I decided to turn it on and play around to see its performance. First of all, it indeed has some minor bleeding in the left and right corners, but almost unnoticeable when I watch a movie. Now there is the only way to battle with milky hues that were mentioned in the previous review and make this monitor somewhat decent. You MUST run the monitor using NVIDIA settings (if you have NVidia graphics card of course). I connected the monitor through DVI cable to my GTX 1070. First it may complain that ""there is no connection"", but all you need to do is unplug the cable and plug it again. After this, turn the monitor on, and install ASUS PB287Q driver (there is no CD included, so you have to download it from internet and know how to install a driver through Device Manager manually, because it's not an executable file). Then, the monitor will be recognized as ASUS, and not a Generic Monitor. Second, run the display through Splendid on sRGB or Standard mode with 0 or 25 VividPixels, and open Nvidia Control Panel>Display>Adjust Desktop color settings. If you have only one monitor, go to 2 option (Choose how color is set) and select ""Use NVIDIA settings"". Now for my taste I had to adjust the sliders like this: a) Brightness - 45%, b) Contrast - between 65 - 70%, c) Gamma - 1.00, d) Digital vibrance - leave it at 50% or slide to 55%. e) Hue - 0. Click Apply. Then go to change Resolution, select 3840x2160 if it is not selected just yet, refresh rate is by defaukt 60Hz. Go to 3 optios (Apply the following settings): Desktop color depth - make it Highest (32-bit), Output color format - RGB, Output color depth  - make it 10bpc and lat Output dynamic range - make it Full instead of Limited.Now remember that your video player may play movies using its own settings too. If you want to change that, play a video file on one half of the screen and Go to NVIDIA Control Panel>Video>Adjust video color settings. Now watch a video frame with the native video player settings and with the NVIDIA settings. Again, here I had to adjust contrast by 60%. Also here go to Advanced and select Full Dynamic range as well. Try it and see if you like video image now. If you mess up, you always can reset settings in NVIDIA Control Panel ""Restore defaults in the upper right window) and Reset changes under Monitors menu next to each mode.In Windows 7, I also adjusted the size of text into 150% through Control  Panel>Appearance and Personalization>Display and then adjusted Clear Type text so the fonts are crisp and readable without a need of more than 25 VividPixels (which will make lots of noise on photos and is not advised by Tom's Hardware and other respectable review channels). In addition, I went to Control  Panel>Appearance and Personalization>Personalization>Window Color and Appearance and selected ""Advanced Appearance Settings"". Here you can increase (A) Icon item font (!) size to 16 anbd (B) Menu item size to 27 and font (!) size to 14. You can change a font into Arial or other if you like, but i left it on default.Looks like the tweaking part is over. ASUS CAN display nice colors, but I am still unhappy that it takes so much to get into the crispy contrast that my old display had right out of the box - Dell SP2309W, which is 23 inch, has 2048x1152 resolution and stunning 80,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio. Another minor issue, which is albeit annoying is that I cannot push the icon next to very edge of the right side of the monitor. Do not know how to fix that.

"159","Bought it for a company client I'm working with, since this costs a fraction of what a professional IPS monitor such as NEC or Eizo would cost... I have a MultiSync PA271w with CCFL backlight, and I would say the Asus is about 80% as good as the NEC. The color accuracy is uite good. Viewing angle is wide, but there is noticeable color shift if viewed at an angle.  Light bleeding is well controlled. The black level is lacking.  A pure black image appear quite gray to the naked eye.I like the menu system, very easy and quick to work with.  The included speaker is very weak, murky sounding and is faced toward the back of the monitor, but it's there if you need a speaker...

"160","I don't feel like writing a review right now, but this monitor does deserve a 5 star rating, and at least a few good words. Maybe I'll get around to writing a better review once I've had the monitor for about 12 months.*Display port*Very high build quality*Screen position is fully customizable with 5 axis rotation and also height adjustment*Very, very accurate color pallet, blacks are very dark for the price point, they are not TRUE black however, there is a little bit of grey scale*Ghosting is minimal and not noticeable*There is some back light bleed on the corners, but at the right viewing angle, it is almost unnoticeable*Speakers work, but are horrible, only use in an absolute bind*3 year warranty backed by Asus's great return program, buy with confidence. I've dealt with Asus suport in the past, they really do have amazing customer service; it's not a myth.Overall, this is probably going to be the best 1080p IPS monitor on the market without stepping into the ridiculous price ranges. I really don't think there is a better IPS monitor at this price point. Some reviewers have stated the quality is on par with a Dell Ultra Sharp, I've never seen one (Dell) in person, but I can say that this Asus does indeed look very, very nice.I initially received a panel with a dead pixel, and one of the face buttons was recessed on the right side. Amazon promptly sent me a replacement and provided a return shipping label, hassle free using the 100% automated system.

"164","I purchased this display to use with my 2011 MacBook Pro. I also purchased a Mini Display Port to Display Port cable because the three included cables (DVI, HDMI, and Display Port) were not compatible with the Thunderbolt port on my Mac. I use it mainly for coding, basic Photoshop editing, Word and Excel, and an occasional movie or video game. Out of the box the color is good although I do not use it for high-end photo editing or graphic design. The only adjustment I made was to crank down the brightness so it didn't blind me when the lights in my office were dimmed. The stand is very functional. In addition to easy tilt, swivel, and height adjustments, the display can be rotated from landscape to portrait orientation.Minor complaints: the Display Port cable carries sound to the mini jack port on the back of the display but there is no system level (keyboard) volume control if you plug speakers in that way. Also, there are no USB ports on the display.Big complaint: sometimes the display will not wake up from sleep when used with a MacBook Pro. After about two weeks this happened to mine and I ended up exchanging it for the same model. Amazon is absolutely the best when it comes to returns and exchanges. After a few weeks the same problem happened with my replacement monitor. This time I Googled a little deeper and found a solution. When the display will not wake from sleep you have to unplug the power cord to reset it. Turning it off with the power switch does not reset the sleep circuitry. Crawling under the desk to turn my display back on sucks. My solution was to set Display Sleep to never in the Energy Saver settings and then use a black screen saver. I shut down and turn everything off when I leave for the day so this works for me.Overall, this is a great display. 2560 x 1440 resolution for $400! How great is that? And the color is good, too.

"170","I had recently gone from a 24"" 1440 to a 27"" 1080 (Asus) display, the lack of vertical resolution that I was used had me looking for a 27"" 1440 display after a month. I bought this display after looking long and hard at buying a knock down 2560x1440 from one of the Korean sellers.  Based on my wants/needs no dead pixels, easy vesa mount and I prefer on screen control display, I opted to spend the extra money and go with this model.  The display mounted nice on my existing vesa mount, the included dual link dvi cable hooked up to the graphics card (EVGA 680SC).  One of the other reviewers had an issue with cables claiming Alienware users should use a mini display port cable.  I'm not sure where they are coming from with this, mini display ports with PC's are and option to run multiple monitors (AMD eyefinity).  Considering the resolution of this display the typical user won't be running 3 of these displays with the current crop of video cards.  The mini display connection is a Mac issue (keep in mind it WAS a Mac propriety design).  Looking at the apple info page the mac dual link to mini adapter runs at 1920x1200, why pay for a 2560x1440 display if you are running at a lower res?  Bottom line the dual link cable is the the connection to use for this display the other connections should be for occasional use to connect your lower res hardware. With general use I have not encountered a dead pixel, I have not run a special app to see if there are any.

"171","This monitor is beautiful. The colors are vibrant, clear. The bevel is a perfect subtle matte finish. You can turn off the annoying power indicator light (honestly why do monitors even have that anymore).But it has a crippling problem recognizing DisplayPort. Google ""asus PB278Q displayport detection issue"" and you will find hundreds of unresolved threads with people complaining about their Asus giving them the dreaded ""no signal"" while using DisplayPort. This usually happens to me when switching between my TV connected by HDMI and this monitor. If I switch the display mode in windows to output to only the second monitor (my TV), windows will forget the monitor, and the next time I boot up, it will fail to send its specifications to Windows, and Windows will be unable to output the right signal. It only happens sometimes; It's very temperamental, like all of the most annoying tech problems. The only way to fix it is to disconnect the power from the monitor, reconnect and turn it back on. I can prevent this from happening by choosing ""duplicate"" and simply turning off the monitor.I can't really say it's a dealbreaker, though. This monitor is the most beautiful one I've ever owned. It's incredibly bright; I actually have it running at 45% brightness in my basement room, even with light coming in through the windows. 100% is ridiculously bright for the setting in which I use it. I have seen no ghosting or bleeding, and I have noticed no lag, even while playing first person shooter games. I'm a fan of simplistic, minimalistic design, and I hate fancy over-designed bevels, so the design of the monitor is perfect for me. It's all rectangles with very subtle curves on the corners, much like IKEA furniture design, so it looks great on my desk and doesn't distract me from what is on the screen. It makes me want to upgrade my speakers to something to better match the simplistic, angular, all-black motif.This monitor is a fantastic buy, but don't expect it to be completely frustration-free.",19,16,-3,35,45.7142857142857,54.2857142857143,"   monitor  beautiful  colors  vibrant clear  bevel   perfect subtle matte finish  can turn   annoying power indicator light honestly   monitors even   anymorebut    crippling problem recognizing displayport google asus pbq displayport detection issue   will find hundreds  unresolved threads  people complaining   asus giving   dreaded  signal  using displayport  usually happens    switching   tv connected  hdmi   monitor   switch  display mode  windows  output    second monitor  tv windows will forget  monitor   next time  boot   will fail  send  specifications  windows  windows will  unable  output  right signal   happens sometimes   temperamental like     annoying tech problems   way  fix    disconnect  power   monitor reconnect  turn  back   can prevent   happening  choosing duplicate  simply turning   monitori cant really say   dealbreaker though  monitor    beautiful one ive ever owned  incredibly bright  actually   running   brightness   basement room even  light coming    windows   ridiculously bright   setting    use    seen  ghosting  bleeding    noticed  lag even  playing first person shooter games im  fan  simplistic minimalistic design   hate fancy overdesigned bevels   design   monitor  perfect     rectangles   subtle curves   corners much like ikea furniture design   looks great   desk  doesnt distract       screen  makes  want  upgrade  speakers  something  better match  simplistic angular allblack motifthis monitor   fantastic buy  dont expect    completely frustrationfree

"176","Great monitor, it does what it's supposed to do.  Images look sharp and great.  It runs at 2560x1440 resolution, exactly matching the maximum possible resolution of dual-link DVI.  That's what I use, and it looks beautiful.  I standardized on DVI because that's what all of my devices can produce natively (including my trusty early-2008 MacBook Pro, which maxes out at precisely this resolution).There's a major usability quirk, though.  Whenever your video signal is interrupted for any reason, even if it's for a small fraction of a second, the monitor automatically switches to a different video input!This is frustrating, because I use a DVI switchbox, and every time I switch sources, the monitor flipped to VGA!  The only workaround is to standardize on only one input source.  Don't ever plug more than one input into this monitor at the same time.I eventually used a second monitor for VGA, to work around this problem.  I used Asus tech support and they said there was no way to turn off this ""feature"", unfortunately.This monitor also forces you to wait through an ASUS ""splash screen"" every time you turn the monitor on.  That gets rather old.  I don't need to sit through an ""Inspiring Innovation - Persistent Perfection"" mini-commercial every time!  It gets annoying having to wait.  There's also no way to turn off this ""feature"".If the video input is interrupted for a slightly longer period of time (assuming you have only one video connection plugged in), the monitor will turn itself off.  Guess what, no way to turn this ""feature"" off either!  How frustrating.  Whenever my computer goes into low-power mode from being left unattended for a while, I have to manually turn the monitor on again, by pressing the power button, it won't just come back on again when the video signal is resumed.  And then there's the mini-commercial again!I wish the thing would just sit on the video source that I had selected, permanently, and never change, and never turn itself off.  Would it be too hard for Asus to do this?  Evidently so.The monitor does have a really good stand, with just enough friction and weight to hold it nicely into place, while still allowing it to be set to a variety of angles and rotations to suit your needs.  I can rotate it 90 degrees, in order to use it in vertical mode, which is great for coding.  Unfortunately, it only rotates in one direction, to the right.  It's exactly the wrong direction from what would be needed in order to lift the video cables to a nice easy angle for access!  I wish they had chosen to make the monitor rotate in the opposite direction instead, or better yet, allow it to rotate 180 degrees to allow choice of direction.Although this monitor is nice and big, the cables connect at a surprisingly tight angle.  It would have been nice if Asus would have positioned the connectors at a more friendly angle, perhaps with a shield at the back to cover them up.  Instead, Asus tries to hide the cables from sight by making them cram in at an awkward 90 degree angle behind another bend.  This is not the greatest design, and it's probably bad for the cables over time, because they have to be bent in order to fit.Asus does include cables, though.  In addition to the power cord, you get 1 video cord of each type: VGA, DVI, HDMI, and DisplayPort.  The included DVI cable is dual-link, so it will work at the maximum resolution of this monitor.Also, the description said that it came with speakers built-in.  I don't see any holes in the monitor where the speakers would be.  Maybe they're sealed up entirely in the plastic?  I don't use any video cables with audio (I use only DVI and VGA video), so can't test this.I wouldn't use this monitor for sound.  There's no convenient volume control, you have to go through the menus just to access the volume control, so using it every day for sound would be a pain.  There's no headphone jack on the front, either, which would have been nice to have.Another nice thing would have been a built-in USB hub in the monitor, as many monitors have.  Considering Asus is known for throwing in all sorts of silly features and gimmicks, in order to distinguish themselves, this is a rather surprising omission.Don't let the negative tone of this review get you the wrong idea.  I'm still rather happy with this monitor, it's a great step up from what I used to have.  I'm just pointing out its quirks, in hopes that somebody at Asus will read this and make the next monitor even better.Josh",16,30,14,46,65.2173913043478,34.7826086956522,"  great monitor     supposed    images look sharp  great   runs  x resolution exactly matching  maximum possible resolution  duallink dvi  thats   use   looks beautiful   standardized  dvi  thats     devices can produce natively including  trusty early macbook pro  maxes   precisely  resolutiontheres  major usability quirk though  whenever  video signal  interrupted   reason even     small fraction   second  monitor automatically switches   different video inputthis  frustrating   use  dvi switchbox  every time  switch sources  monitor flipped  vga    workaround   standardize   one input source  dont ever plug   one input   monitor    timei eventually used  second monitor  vga  work around  problem   used asus tech support   said    way  turn   feature unfortunatelythis monitor also forces   wait   asus splash screen every time  turn  monitor    gets rather old   dont need  sit   inspiring innovation  persistent perfection minicommercial every time   gets annoying   wait  theres also  way  turn   featureif  video input  interrupted   slightly longer period  time assuming    one video connection plugged   monitor will turn    guess   way  turn  feature  either   frustrating  whenever  computer goes  lowpower mode   left unattended       manually turn  monitor    pressing  power button  wont just come back     video signal  resumed    theres  minicommercial againi wish  thing  just sit   video source    selected permanently  never change  never turn        hard  asus     evidently sothe monitor    really good stand  just enough friction  weight  hold  nicely  place  still allowing    set   variety  angles  rotations  suit  needs   can rotate   degrees  order  use   vertical mode   great  coding  unfortunately   rotates  one direction   right   exactly  wrong direction     needed  order  lift  video cables   nice easy angle  access   wish   chosen  make  monitor rotate   opposite direction instead  better yet allow   rotate  degrees  allow choice  directionalthough  monitor  nice  big  cables connect   surprisingly tight angle      nice  asus   positioned  connectors    friendly angle perhaps   shield   back  cover    instead asus tries  hide  cables  sight  making  cram    awkward  degree angle behind another bend      greatest design   probably bad   cables  time      bent  order  fitasus  include cables though   addition   power cord  get  video cord   type vga dvi hdmi  displayport   included dvi cable  duallink   will work   maximum resolution   monitoralso  description said   came  speakers builtin   dont see  holes   monitor   speakers    maybe theyre sealed  entirely   plastic   dont use  video cables  audio  use  dvi  vga video  cant test thisi wouldnt use  monitor  sound  theres  convenient volume control    go   menus just  access  volume control  using  every day  sound    pain  theres  headphone jack   front either     nice  haveanother nice thing     builtin usb hub   monitor  many monitors   considering asus  known  throwing   sorts  silly features  gimmicks  order  distinguish     rather surprising omissiondont let  negative tone   review get   wrong idea  im still rather happy   monitor   great step     used    im just pointing   quirks  hopes  somebody  asus will read   make  next monitor even betterjosh

"179","Highly recommended. Seemed solidly made as I assembled it. (I turned one screw, plumbing the limits of my mechanical abilities). Small intakes of breath occur as I re-watch some of my favorite movies and am startled by this displays images.The details: I had a 3-year old Dell U24xxx IPS 24-in monitor at 1920x1200 over HDMI. The ASUS was to be a second monitor. Both were to be attached to a 3-year old HP DV7 laptop (i7 chip - 4 cores) running Windows 7 64 bit ""premium"". normally at less than 20% of capacity; The HP has a Radeon 1 GB video adapter whose maximum resolution seems to be 1920 x 1200. I bought a USB 3.0 video adapter to provide the native 2560 x 1440 resolution of the ASUS panel over a USB Displayport connection (which my laptop did not have). I use the computer for high-quality music playback, video, and some minor web surfing.With minimal calibration (using Microsoft's free Win 7 tool) and using the ASUS monitor's ""RGB"" setting, results are most pleasing. I am seeing text that seems laser etched and not too small; I use these displays at about one to two feet away. Revisiting the film ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" illustrates how colors are rendered more subtly and, I suspect, accurately than on the (3-year old) Dell. Old, badly faded prints of black and white movies are much more clearer, and I am seeing a great deal of new detail in just about everything. Flesh tones are rendered far more naturally than on the Dell. There is no comparison in that regard.I had anticipated potential problems in the form of, perhaps, buggy operation (of the USB-to-Displayport video adapter), but the whole thing (i.e., laptop + USB video adapter + two external monitors) seems to be doing quite well. The USB/Displayport software consumes some additional CPU; the laptop runs at a higher temperature than before and the fan is (it seems) almost always on. Otherwise, no quibbles.The 3 year warranties on this ASUS were a draw for me. I registered at the manufacturer's web site, but not sure if I was successful (no confirmation email).I did have a bit of a rocky start. I ordered another manufacturer's 32-inch panel (which, although attractive in design, is more like a television), but I was unable to assemble it out of the box. Despite Herculean efforts and the enlisting of an auto mechanic's aid, the panel would not attach to the stand. While frustrating, it, perhaps, turned out to my benefit (i.e., the ASUS monitor). While I was waiting for a return-and-replace to transpire, I tried the ASUS monitor, and romance blossomed. And, after some reflection, in a glorious burst of rationalization, I decided that a 24 and 27 inch monitor pair was more symmetrically pleasing than a 24 and 32 inch duo.

"185","It's a great monitor. Pretty good before Calibration. nearly perfect AFTER calibration.Before Calibration, the monitors Gamma is a bit off.. making blacks and dark colors appear a bit washed out or grey.Not too much, but just enough to notice. White point is also slightly off without calibration.And these slight issues really can't be corrected with the monitors built-in options and controls.There's a reason this isn't under the ""Pro-Art"" series of monitors.The monitor still looks very good, but it's worth noting that the colors and greyscale are not 100% accurate out of the box.Viewing angles top to bottom and side to side are great. My unit has no noticeable light bleed either.After calibration, using a Spyder4Elite, things improve. White point looks perfect, gamma is corrected, and colors are accurate. The monitor measured with 100% SRGB coverage, which is the standard all content is mastered in, making it perfect for games, netflix, youtube... etc.As for AdobeRGB, which some photographers might care about, I measured 80% coverage. Please keep in mind, Adobe RGB only applies to material shot with the AdobeRGB setting and with software supporting the AdobeRGB standard... basically photographers with nice cameras using photoshop and other high-end software. Games, movies, and all internet content is mastered in the SRGB standard. applying AdobeRGB to this type of content will OVER SATURATE the colors much more than intended. It's worth noting that the equivalent Pro-Art series monitor is advertised to have nearly 100% Adobe RGB coverage, which might make it a better fit for some users.Color accuracy of this display after calibration was also excellent, averaging a delta-e measurement of about 1.2 according to the Spyder4Elite using a 48-point color test.Pros: Good color accuracy and overall picture even without calibration. Pretty much perfect after calibration. Covers 100% SRGB. Nice Matte-display, which isn't grainy looking. Doesn't pick up glare. plenty of inputs. Good stand with pivot, tilt, rotation, and height adjustments. VESA mount compatible.Cons: Lack of any real deep built-in hardware controls to adjust colors and color temperatures.

"190","My last G220fb died about a month ago and I had to get something, just to continue on. The PB278Q is a very nice monitor and I am happy with it. Even tho I would have liked to have individual RGB contrast control instead of just gain control, the colors are not that far off in the mid range to be a problem to many or even noticeable for day to day non-photography use. The black is nothing like a CRT, tho it is much better then many other flat panels I've seen.The wide screen format is a bit of a drag when working with many things, even tho it has more pixels then a regular 1080 display. Moving from a 4:3 or 16:10 display to the 16x9 wide screen is very cramping vertically for many things on a computer. Not to say the jog bar at the bottom of many on-line vids obstructs part of the vid on the 16:9 wide screen monitor that was never an issue on taller format displays. Perhaps some day web pages will be better on wide screen displays.For working on stuff, the 1440 height is very nice to have, much better then only 1080 pixels. So over all, without full-screen stuff going, the display is a very nice upgrade from the 1920x1200 B243PWL and a marginal emergency replacement for the dead 2048x1536 G220fb. Yes I am happy with the PB278Q, it will just take some getting use to the lack of vertical real estate.",10,11,1,21,52.3809523809524,47.6190476190476,"   last gfb died   month ago     get something just  continue   pbq    nice monitor    happy   even tho    liked   individual rgb contrast control instead  just gain control  colors    far    mid range    problem  many  even noticeable  day  day nonphotography use  black  nothing like  crt tho   much better  many  flat panels ive seenthe wide screen format   bit   drag  working  many things even tho    pixels   regular  display moving      display   x wide screen   cramping vertically  many things   computer   say  jog bar   bottom  many online vids obstructs part   vid    wide screen monitor   never  issue  taller format displays perhaps  day web pages will  better  wide screen displaysfor working  stuff   height   nice   much better    pixels    without fullscreen stuff going  display    nice upgrade   x bpwl   marginal emergency replacement   dead x gfb yes   happy   pbq  will just take  getting use   lack  vertical real estate

"191","Solid monitor for the price, beautiful picture and can do 60hz SST.  Normal I buy new but since this was a gaming rig I figured lets try the Amazon Warehouse deal.  The last time I purchased from them it was in original packaging and the monitor was in mint condition.  This time it arrived wrapped in bubble wrap and foam and the screen was gouged.  In addition the stand was damaged and missing the plastic end caps along with the rear cable cover and the display port cable as well.  I ended up buying another but this time made sure it was in the original packaging.  The second one arrived perfect and in very good condition.  As for the monitor, it does have off angle viewing issues, mainly fade due to the TN screen but otherwise if you can buy one for $400 in mint condition it is well worth it.  I have a professional Asus PQ 32 inch 4K on my macpro and that display is amazing.  But for 8x the price it should be.

"198","Amazing!After using my first 1440p monitor (Auria from Microcenter), I was hooked. This monitor is head and shoulders beyond that Auria monitor which has been relegated to secondary display duties since the new ASUS was installed.

"204","This is by far the best monitor I've ever owned. I have a really good LG 1080p IPS monitor and a crappy HP Monitor. I bought an EVGA GTX 780 6GB card a couple of months ago and it was always in the back of my mind to get a 1440p display. It seems that 1440p is the sweet spot right now for gamers. 4K is too expensive and too brutal on CPUs/GPUs at the moment unless you're going to spend some major cash on an SLI or Crossfire set up.... for mediocre performance at 4K.No matter what site I went to this monitor is the recommended monitor from price to quality. The fact it comes with every single cable is outstanding. Even audio cables. Amazing Asus. 3 year warranty too as well.Amazon packaged the display very well. I was surprised to see an outer Amazon box over the Asus packaged box. Good job Amazon that's why I continue to shop with you. My unit arrived with no dead pixels or backlight bleed. I am very happy about that. The color accuracy is outstanding out of the box. I didn't calibrate anything only thing I did was lower the brightness and it's superb in every way over my other monitor. Text is so crisp and sharp... no artifacts around letters. Colors pop, blacks are black, and it's the perfect blend of a matte/glossy display. Right in the middle... like glossy matte. The stand is very sturdy and feels premium. There's height adjustment, pivot, tilt, and swivel.

"205","I have only had this for 3 days.  The Asus PB287Q 28"" LED-Lit 4K monitor arrived promptly via my Prime shipping and it worked perfectly/instantly out-of-the-box and after connecting it to my computer.  NO DEAD PIXELS.  NO SLEEP/WAKE ISSUES. This is a fantastic upgrade from my old I-INC 28"" LED that served me well and is still going strong actually, just no backlighting. . . I paid over $700 for that back in 2009 after my Viewsonic 27"" started it's intermittent black-screening, so this 4K 28"" at $560 bucks is a steal to say the least. The base is sturdy and the monitor is very stable as it sits at about half of the total adjustment height.  I also like the menu scheme and setup,, which I never can say,  as it actually depicts the up-down arrows, enter and back functions on screen instead of bezel painted on tiny icons that my eyes can no longer discern.  The minimal personal preference setup was easy and concise.The only con that I can find so far is the illuminated power light mini strip, on the bottom of it, reflecting off of my glass top computer desk.  It is a white led that you can only see from the front if you are already sitting level with the monitor.

"206","This is a fantastic monitor.  I love it.  Just plugged it in and fired it up, basically two cables: HDMI and power.  It all works like a charm, the only adjustment I made was to turn down the brightness just a little.  No issues whatsoever, except for a little lip at the back that makes it slightly challenging to plug in cables.Completely adjustable angles and height - very nice.  That's something Dell doesn't always seem to get.Very clear and sharp.  Bright colors and excellent contrast.I was torn for a while between this and the 4K version, but until Windows 10 comes out for real I think there will be some difficulty with scaling fonts and such for so many pixels, so I saved over a hundred bucks and opted for this model, WQHD is plenty of pixels and although it doesn't quite cover remote-desktop to my 30"" unit at work, it is very close, and a lot better than the 1920x1200 Dell which gets to be a secondary display now.I may eventually regret not going all the way for the 4K monitor, as it is 60hz and all, but with the current state of Windows font scaling it would have bugged me too much to have to use 125% fonts and deal with all the resulting inconsistencies and odd looking panels as a result.  I think 2560x1440 is the best available choice right now unless you want to spend a lot more money for a 30"" monitor, or buy something that's been on the market for 5 years.

"207","I purchased a Korean 27"" IPS monitor with 2560x1440 resolution  for about $365 on eBay with 2560x1440 resolution and was happy with it except that the power supply died after a year and the monitor started flickering after two years. As I always do, I purchased a Squaretrade warranty and when they couldn't repair it, they refunded the money and I decided to purchase a brand name monitor with the same resolution at a reasonable price. With Samsung PLS rather than LG IPS technology, this was the only well rated choice at an affordable price without my having to spend at least $100 more for a Dell Monitor.Despite all the positive reviews, I was very concerned I might get a monitor with dead or stuck pixels.The monitor-at the best price available-arrived in two days via Amazon Prime with the excellent manufacturer's packaging in an additional Amazon carton.With trepidation, I took it out of the box, attached the stand in well under a minute with the attached screw, set it on my desktop, chose the HDMI cable to go with my Radeon HD7500 video card (there are also DVI, VGA, Displayport and power cables included!), plugged the hdmi cable into the monitor, turned it on and held my breath while it booted up worried about stuck or dead pixels or back lighting issues. I ran several pixel tests and I was excited to find NO problems and I was delighted to also see that the monitor was pre-calibrated. There is no CD with drivers but I downloaded what was necessary from the Asus site.I watch a lot of foreign movies on the monitor and -for the price-I am very happy with my purchase. At this price point, you can't do any better unless you want to take your chances with a Korean monitor that is not serviceable in this country.Thank you, Amazon and-just in case-get a Squaretrade warranty. Asus has a 3 year warranty but I had a warranty on my Nexus 7 from Asus. Asus repaired one problem with an over the air software update but sent the tablet back poorly packed and with bubbles under the screen. I then sent the tablet to Squaretrade and it came back with the screen issue fixed in much shorter time than Asus took and well packed.",13,14,1,27,51.8518518518518,48.1481481481481,"   purchased  korean  ips monitor  x resolution      ebay  x resolution   happy   except   power supply died   year   monitor started flickering  two years   always   purchased  squaretrade warranty    couldnt repair   refunded  money   decided  purchase  brand name monitor    resolution   reasonable price  samsung pls rather  lg ips technology     well rated choice   affordable price without    spend  least     dell monitordespite   positive reviews    concerned  might get  monitor  dead  stuck pixelsthe monitorat  best price availablearrived  two days via amazon prime   excellent manufacturers packaging   additional amazon cartonwith trepidation  took     box attached  stand  well   minute   attached screw set    desktop chose  hdmi cable  go   radeon hd video card   also dvi vga displayport  power cables included plugged  hdmi cable   monitor turned    held  breath   booted  worried  stuck  dead pixels  back lighting issues  ran several pixel tests    excited  find  problems    delighted  also see   monitor  precalibrated    cd  drivers   downloaded   necessary   asus sitei watch  lot  foreign movies   monitor    pricei   happy   purchase   price point  cant   better unless  want  take  chances   korean monitor    serviceable   countrythank  amazon andjust  caseget  squaretrade warranty asus    year warranty     warranty   nexus   asus asus repaired one problem     air software update  sent  tablet back poorly packed   bubbles   screen   sent  tablet  squaretrade   came back   screen issue fixed  much shorter time  asus took  well packed

I was looking for a mid-priced one with good to excellent monitor qualities. It turns out there aren't many choices that meet those criteria. Of the ones that did, most of my research indicated the Asus PB278Q would meet my needs. I've owned a number of Asus products over the years and been happy with them. When Amazon had this monitor on sale for about $100 dollars less than the regular price, I bought one.I'm extremely pleased with the purchase. The colors are bright and vivid. The gray to gray response time is plenty good enough for home office and graphics work and fast enough that I don't really notice it while gaming. The WQHD resolution blew me away as I have a rig with enough processing power to drive the display. The only small con to the monitor is a refresh rate of 60 MHz. That leads to some visible strobing effects at times. However, in the price range I was willing to pay, almost all the monitors had the same refresh rate.

"221","This monitor is good, not great to me. I've calibrated the color and tinkered around with the settings as much as I can, and it just doesn't look as good as you'd hope it would at the price of $450 (+tax). It's settings and functionality are solid and definitely passible, but the colors and overall video quality aren't quite as vivid as they are on a mac. Good monitor, not great. I'd say save up and get the Thunderbolt personally.EDIT- After using this monitor for about a week and a half, I will say that I am returning it because I am not completely satisfied. It's picture is not as vivid as some others here have described (even after color calibration) and the video does not really look crisp to me.

"246","No bad pixels and very good performance. I needed monitor with a decent color gamut and decent gaming performance. I'm into amateur photography, so I need to order a spectrophotometer to calibrate the monitor, but upon using it for the first time I could tell that the dynamic range and contrast were much better then my old monitor. The trick is to get the calibration close to reality so that when you send a picture to a photo printing service, you will get what you saw on the screen. This monitor is not a pro photographers monitor, but it is better than average and a lot cheaper.The buttons and adjustment menus are hard to use or make sense out of, like a lot of monitors. Some day, the engineers will get it right and create an easy to use system or a way to program the setting from the operating system instead of the buttons. However, out of the box I had little to adjust for immediate use. I needed to turn up the brightness and adjust the color temperature a bit, but not much else.This monitor is connected to a GTX 780 via a displayport cable. In games I have seen no ghosting or shadows. In action/fps games, there is the usual blur that you see with all LCD panels when you rapidly turn, but I expected that. I'm playing at full resolution and I have no complaints. The pixel pitch is so small that anti-alias is really not needed at such a high resolution, it is actually difficult to make out individual pixels unless you have your nose up to the monitor. The color and contrast in the games is very nice, but most people want to know about ghosting and shadowing. I really haven't noticed any. If I played for awhile on CRTs then started using the LCD, I would see the blur difference in the response time for sure, but it is not horrible. If you are used to LCDs, you don't need to worry about playing on one of these. You would have to be a competition level gamer to want better, and you would probably be playing with a lower res 1ms monitor with 60% color gamut.",11,11,0,22,50,50,"   bad pixels   good performance  needed monitor   decent color gamut  decent gaming performance im  amateur photography   need  order  spectrophotometer  calibrate  monitor  upon using    first time   tell   dynamic range  contrast  much better   old monitor  trick   get  calibration close  reality     send  picture   photo printing service  will get   saw   screen  monitor    pro photographers monitor    better  average   lot cheaperthe buttons  adjustment menus  hard  use  make sense   like  lot  monitors  day  engineers will get  right  create  easy  use system   way  program  setting   operating system instead   buttons however    box   little  adjust  immediate use  needed  turn   brightness  adjust  color temperature  bit   much elsethis monitor  connected   gtx  via  displayport cable  games   seen  ghosting  shadows  actionfps games    usual blur   see   lcd panels   rapidly turn   expected  im playing  full resolution     complaints  pixel pitch   small  antialias  really  needed    high resolution   actually difficult  make  individual pixels unless    nose    monitor  color  contrast   games   nice   people want  know  ghosting  shadowing  really havent noticed    played  awhile  crts  started using  lcd   see  blur difference   response time  sure     horrible    used  lcds  dont need  worry  playing  one         competition level gamer  want better    probably  playing   lower res ms monitor   color gamut

"248","I finally pulled the trigger and ordered this monitor last week. After a long and grueling quest of sifting through countless review sites and forum posts with opinions on resolution, aspect ratio, refresh rate, why TN panels are better than IPS and vice versa. I'm glad I finally decided on this model.This Asus replaced my old 23"" Acer 1080p monitor. After seeing games in action running at 2560x1440, there's just no going back. Ever. First games I loaded up were Tomb Raider and Hitman Absolution, mostly on high settings. My jaw about fell on the floor. Colors are so vibrant and crisp, blacks are deep and rich, and whites are bright white. The level of detail over 1080 is just astounding. 27"" seems to be the sweet spot for size. There's a lot of real estate for webpages, videos, etc.Build quality is top notch. The stand is very solid, and it's got HEIGHT ADJUSTMENT! The monitor shipped with zero stuck pixels, no ghosting that I've noticed, and very little back light bleed. Back light bleed was pretty low on my priority list anyway. Very rarely am I sitting there just starting at a black screen for hours on end.As of right now, I have not received my GTX 780 in the mail, I should get it next week. I'm currently running an EVGA Classified 448 Core 560TI, overclocked to the max. I'm amazed at how well this card runs most games, even at 1440p. My 1.25gb of VRAM was maxed out on Tomb Raider and Hitman, and I was getting some frame rate issues, clearly in need of a GPU upgrade. Other games like Dishonored, Borderlands 2 and Guild Wars 2 run beautiful. I'd definitely recommend getting a GPU with at least 3gb of VRAM though, with this high of a resolution.If you're on the fence about upgrading to 1440, just do it.

"251","I don't normally write reviews, but because this monitor does not seem to have that many and is only $195 after rebate and before tax, this is definitely worth mentioning. I upgraded from an old Acer X221W which was CCFL backlit with a 1000:1 contrast ratio. So to me, this monitor blows it out of the water. I have never seen colors pop so naturally and text look so sharp. Blacks are very deep, but not enough to muddy up details. Plenty of ports to keep it future proof, and the extra 4 USB ports and speakers are an added bonus.  Also, the fact that this thing is capable of rotating in all 3 axis, and as the ability to adjust height, makes it all the more capable and worth it. The base is also extremely solid as it is completely metal. Also did I mention that this monitor is actually designed for professionals in mind? But for $195, its much cheaper than other competitors such as the Dell UltraSharps, and LG IPS series.No dead pixels is an added bonus. Perhaps I am lucky, compared to some of these other reviews I've seen.The only cons are that the speakers are weak (but what were you expecting....) however, they are much better then a typical laptop's built in speakers. Also, even with IPS the colors do shift somewhat to a cooler temperature when viewed at angles greater than 65 degrees away from center, however sharpness remains intact.If you're looking at other Asus monitors such as the VS239H-P, spend the extra $35 and buy this. It has more ports, is much more adjustable, and has a solid base it's also built from matte plastic which feels much more solid as opposed to the glossy kind found in cheaper monitors.

"253","I have four of these monitors - all acquired in 2014.  Of the four two had to be replaced as defective. I have a continuing problem with two of them which is that at power or wake, randomly, they initialize to 1920 X 1200 instead of the correct native 2560 X 1440 resolution. The two that exhibit this problem have an earlier hardware version than the two which which don't. I can tell this, not by part or model number but because of the arrangement of connectors on the back and differences in the on-screen controls.  All four run on Display Port connections.I run them on an AMD Radeon HD 7800 series card with six Display Port outputs (VisionTek HD 7870 Model 900548) on an ASUS Sabertooth Z87 with Intel i7-4770K. Currently on Windows 10, previously on Windows 8.1.It is impossible for me to determine the root cause between Windows, AMD, VisionTek or ASUS. However, the fact that two monitors don't exhibit this problem is a key.  On Windows 8.1, this problem went away with one of the later patches about which Microsoft noted that they had discovered a problem with their video initialization code that impacted only some users. The problem returned with Windows 10 which suggests that this could be some MS problem that somehow was fixed in 8.1 but not in 10.

"259","I upgraded from two Samsung P2450H Monitors to two ASUS PB238Q Monitors.  I had a chance to compare the two brands side by side. The PB238Q's color and contrast are superior. The difference in their corresponding brightness is imperceptible.I can clearly see light bleeding from the background in both lower corners of the PB238Q. The LED power indicator light is causing the brighter background of the two, though it's radius is smaller than the light bleed from the left corner.I don't play a lot of games, but a few now and then. The 6ms refresh time proves to be more than adequate when I play Tomb Raider 2013.The matte finish on the screen looks nice in my dark room, except that the material glows (interior surface of the screen is reflecting or diffusing light).

"263","I've only had this display a few days, and only had it working for a few hours. But so far I love it... wow!BUT... this is a huge alert to anyone planning to use the DVI connection with a Win 10 environment. In that situation, the monitor does NOT WORK unless you use the special DVI-DL, or DVI ""Dual Link"" cable. One is supplied with the monitor, but I didn't initially use it because its too short, and I was replacing a monitor in an existing installation. My existing cables were DVI-D Single Link cables (check out https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface for a full education!). They conveyed a digital signal to the previous monitor, and worked fine. When I connected the Asus to this system... NADA. No signal. An intermittant ""Out Of Range"" indication on the screen... then nothing.Worried that I had a dead monitor, I hooked it up to an XP system. It worked GREAT! Now I was really stymied. Another, older DVI monitor still worked great on the Win10 system.Monday came and I called Asus. They too were a bit stumped, and instructed me to test a few things. The second person I talked to then had a hunch that perhaps it was the DVI cable not transmitting essential data to the monitor. While he was expressing that hunch, I hooked in the supplied DVI cable, and... voila!... signal.Summary... great monitor. Easily accessible (at least when I called) support staff; friendly and helpful. And warning. Be careful which DVI cable you use. This monitor will work fine with a single link DVI cable in an XP environment (didn't test Win7 or Win8), but NOT in a Win10 environment.

As some reviewers have noted, the available resolution appears to depend on whether one is using an HDMI 1.4 cable or a DVI cable (both are included with the monitor).  When I connected the monitor to my computer with my old HDMI cable, I could not attain more than 1920x1080 resolution.  However, upon switching to the provided DVI cable, resolution went to 2560x1440 with no further setting changes. The resolution and color are incredible.

I'll make a few comparisons based on that upgrade because I really don't have much else to compare it to.  This Asus monitor has an incredible viewing angle. I'm able to watch movies while sitting on the floor without loosing any of the image like I would with my Samsung monitor.  The resolution is the largest benefit.  The real estate increased five fold.  Also, this monitor is Bright!  The contrast is incredible and the dark colors are deep and vibrant.The only con so far is that the monitor base didn't line up completely with the monitor screen.  It looked crooked and it took some bending of plastic to get it to line up correctly.  I think Asus went cheap on the plastic.  That's why I knocked a star off... it was that annoying that I almost considered returning it.  However, for the price you really can not ask for anything better than this.

"267","I bought the monitor less than a month ago for business and charting use, i chose this monitor for its flexible stand and medium sized screen real estate . Out of the box the screen was too bright and the colors were off, almost as if all the colors had a yellow tint to them, this was easily fixed by going into the monitor menu and changing preferences to my liking. After all the modifications the screen looked amazing all colors were perfect and the monitor had great resolution, i was satisfied. This however changed as one night after use i left the monitor open with a charting page displaying on the screen. The monitor flickered with lines running up and down the screen and the charting page permanently appeared on screen even though it had been closed, this was only after 2 days of use. I did the logical thing which was check my connections(HDMI), turn on and off, disconnect from outlet, download any drivers from ASUS, reset all settings, and gave it time to rest to make sure it was cooled off in case it had over heated , NOTHING worked. As i was preparing to ship it back the screen slowly started to come back, the charting page image was slowly disappearing and the monitor flicker less and less, after about an hour the screen had returned to its glory and it has stayed working for about a week now.

"277","Whos it useful for?If you are a computer gamer, and want bright, vivid colors on a large, high resolution screen, then this is the monitor for you. Gaming on this monitor has been almost all positive. The bright colors combined with the amazing viewing angles that the IPS screen offers are truly a joy to look at. The only downside for gaming is the 60hz refresh rate. If you want a higher framerate at the cost of amazing contrast and vivid colors, then this might not be the monitor for you, but for the casual gamer it is amazing.Photography/video professionals will also love this monitor. The high contrast combined with the real-to-life color replication make this one of the best monitors out there for video and photo editing.The average movie/Netflix/YouTube watcher will also love the high definition and contrast that comes with this monitor.Evaluation Criteria and My AssessmentI evaluated this monitor on a few criteria: price, viewing experience, and build quality.1. Price: The monitor was on the more expensive side. The main reason that this monitor has the price tag that it does is because of its high 1440p resolution and IPS screen. The price was justified to me because I will be using it on an $1100 gaming computer.2. Viewing Experience: The viewing experience of this monitor is absolutely amazing. The high resolution makes everything on the screen look amazingly clear. The IPS panel has 178 degree viewing angles so you can view it from anywhere in the room without loss of color and brightness. The other advantage of having an IPS panel is having amazing contrast and true to life color replication, both of which are absolutely stunning on this monitor.3. Build Quality: The build quality of this monitor appears to be of a very high level. The stand that comes with the monitor is extremely solid and has no wiggle at all.

In the ""normal"" orientation, the screen looks great, illumination is very even across the whole screen, shifting my head left and right has little or no impact of how colors appear. However, when rotated 90-degrees, that's not true. The viewing angle in this mode is much more restricted. You can actually see the same thing when unrotated. Tilting the monitor down results in the bottom of the screen appearing faded. Tilting it up has more leeway. The main point here being that you have a fairly limited range of viewing positions when the monitor is rotated 90-degrees. I'm not sure that this peculiar to this monitor; probably not. But it's not mentioned on the specifications anywhere that I can find what the viewing angle range is when rotated.

Even coloration.There is slight ghosting, but make sure you turn off the TraceFree option!  That was making me sick.  It's their attempt to compensate for the ghosting and like most features of that sort, it's not a good idea and should be off by default.There's also noticeable banding in gradients.  Usually you don't see a perfect gradient, but when I work in Maya, one of the backdrops is a gradient across the screen so that's very noticeable.  In all other situations the color looks very good.It's not as good as the screen on my iMac.  It's not as easy on the eyes, not as color accurate.  Not according to my eye.

"286","I was originally torn between getting a 4K (3840 x 2160) monitor, or a 27-Inch WQHD IPS (2560 x 1440).  My intended use is mainly graphics and business work (no gaming), so getting a good monitor with faithful color reproduction and wide viewing angles is extremely important.  Given my price range, it came down to choosing between this monitor with a TN panel instead of an IPS panel.  I decided that the benefit of this monitor's  extra resolution would have a far greater impact than the color accuracy of the IPS model, so I ordered this as an external monitor for my MacBook Pro.  Overall I'm very pleased with my choice, as I'm currently driving this monitor and a 24 inch Dell IPS UltraSharp and I like this one better.  It would be nice if the color reproduction was as good as the Dell's, but you'd end up paying well over double for a display like that.  The Dell is also 1920x1200 whereas this is only 1920x1080, but that's also a minor point.  Even though this is a TN panel instead of an IPS, the viewing angles are very good - far better than the last TN-based monitor that I had years ago.  The picture on this is sharp, clear, and everything is big and easy to read given the 28 inch size.  It worked perfectly with my MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Late 2013), and a single DisplayPort 1.2 cable is all you need for both video and audio connections.  The built-in speakers aren't great, of course, but they're probably better than your average laptop's speakers and it's nice to have the audio positionally synced with the video.  The display has a lot of features, including color modes, and I was able to get it to match perfectly with the Dell.  Overall I'm really pleased with the monitor and I feel that I definitely made the right choice by going with the 4K one.",0,25,25,25,100,0,"    originally torn  getting  k  x  monitor   inch wqhd ips  x    intended use  mainly graphics  business work  gaming  getting  good monitor  faithful color reproduction  wide viewing angles  extremely important  given  price range  came   choosing   monitor   tn panel instead   ips panel   decided   benefit   monitors  extra resolution    far greater impact   color accuracy   ips model   ordered    external monitor   macbook pro  overall im  pleased   choice  im currently driving  monitor    inch dell ips ultrasharp   like  one better     nice   color reproduction   good   dells  youd end  paying well  double   display like    dell  also x whereas    x  thats also  minor point  even though    tn panel instead   ips  viewing angles   good  far better   last tnbased monitor    years ago   picture    sharp clear  everything  big  easy  read given   inch size   worked perfectly   macbook pro retina inch late    single displayport  cable    need   video  audio connections   builtin speakers arent great  course  theyre probably better   average laptops speakers   nice    audio positionally synced   video   display   lot  features including color modes    able  get   match perfectly   dell  overall im really pleased   monitor   feel   definitely made  right choice  going   k one

"300","I'll update this later when I get to use it some. Right off the bat I'm annoyed to find out OS X won't allow me to change HDMI volume from the OS; instead I have to change it on the monitor. Not a big deal with the nicely labeled volume shortcuts shown in the picture, right? Unfortunately, the model I received has 6 dots instead of the logos shown in the Amazon description. Pressing any dot brings up a menu where some of the buttons then immediately do something. Out of the box it's configured to have brightness and ""splendid"" as its shortcuts--no volume. To select volume I had to press any button, press the menu button, navigate to sound, navigate to volume, and then I could change the volume. I found the shortcut setting so now it's a three-step process: press any button, press the button for volume, then change the volume. All-in-all it's the kind of thing that makes me wonder if ASUS had any humans test the product before sending it out the door. Why have a clearly labeled, instant-access volume button you can learn to find with your eyes closed when instead we can make it a multi-step process where you have to focus carefully to do what you want?On the plus side, there are no dead pixels, and the monitor is running nicely at 2560x1440 in Yosemite.",4,7,3,11,63.6363636363636,36.3636363636364,"  ill update  later   get  use   right   bat im annoyed  find  os x wont allow   change hdmi volume   os instead    change    monitor   big deal   nicely labeled volume shortcuts shown   picture right unfortunately  model  received   dots instead   logos shown   amazon description pressing  dot brings   menu     buttons  immediately  something    box  configured   brightness  splendid   shortcutsno volume  select volume    press  button press  menu button navigate  sound navigate  volume     change  volume  found  shortcut setting  now   threestep process press  button press  button  volume  change  volume allinall   kind  thing  makes  wonder  asus   humans test  product  sending    door    clearly labeled instantaccess volume button  can learn  find   eyes closed  instead  can make   multistep process     focus carefully     wanton  plus side    dead pixels   monitor  running nicely  x  yosemite

Bright, clear, sharp images, no dark edges, nice 'texture' to the screen (not too glossy and not too matte). All around great picture.-Nice mounting system.

"309","This monitor has a great picture, with good color that is consistent from a variety of viewing angles.What it sucks at is handling multiple computers.  I use a PC and Mac together and switch between them frequently.  This works fine in most situations, but it doesn't work so well in certain others.The problem is that the monitor has automatic input selection, which means that if one input goes away then the monitor scans and switches to any other input that's still active, and that feature can not be disabled.  This sucks when you're just doing something as basic as restarting a computer, as the monitor will switch to the other computer instead, causing the startup screen to go by unseen.  Switching back right away to watch startup logs isn't possible either because while the monitor is showing the graphic in the upper left corner announcing the input it switched itself to, the buttons are all disabled until that info badge goes away.The other time it becomes a problem is when I'm switching to the computer that's currently off in order to turn it on.  I have to be very careful to switch my keyboard first, bring up the second computer and wait until its video is (hopefully) active before I switch the monitor to it, otherwise the monitor will just switch itself back to the first computer.I wouldn't mind any of this if I could turn off the automatic switching, but there is no option for doing that -- it's always on.I'm still giving the monitor four stars because the picture is great and that's the single-most important thing and because I realize most people don't use multiple computers at once.

"327","I replaced a 24"" 1920x1200 IPS monitor with this 27"" 2560x1440 WQHD resolution PLS LED backlit monitor and love the sharper resolution. Unfortunately with dark displays (aka a black screen, etc.) this display exhibits very noticeable ""backlight bleeding"" along most of the left-hand side of the screen and ""backlight bleeding"" at the lower half of the right-hand side of the screen. I was prepared to return this monitor and request a replacement until I searched the internet and discovered this is a common problem with these flat screen displays, a problem that did not exist on the 24"" 1920x1200 IPS monitor this monitor replaced. That said, I decided to live with this problem as there would be no guarantee a replacement would fix this problem and probably about a 50-50 chance that the replacement monitor might have ""backlight bleeding"" that's even worse.From what I've read about ""backlight bleeding"" the problem occurs because white light from the back lighting source (LEDs for this monitor) bleeds/reflects around where the edges of the display meet the monitor's bezel edges. In most cases the problem can be fixed by adhering black electrical tape along the display edges. But this means disassembling the monitor, separating the screen from the monitor's bezel to apply the black electrical tape and reassembling it again, which would definitely void the monitor's warranty.ASUS is known for their high quality, high performance motherboards and I've been a loyal ASUS motherboard user for years.

"328","Definitely met my expectations!! Loving 4k so much more detail is available.  I'm still fairly new to 4k tv's/monitors so im learning as i go.  4k worked great once I figured out that I needed to use a display port cable in order to utilize the 60hz range. I was using a 4k ready hdmi cable but for some reason It would only display in 4k at 30hz.  Found some posts that suggested a display port cable would have to be used in order to access the 60hz range.  Sure enouhg went out cot a DP cable and presto chango!! 60 hz 4k! looks simply awesome.  Now the only thing i have to figure out is how to adjust mouse sensativity to be more like what i was used to on the 1080 screens.  For some reason the mouse doesn't quite feel right when on the 4k setting..but that has nothing to do with the monitor and more to do with system trying to function with a monitor that has a higher capacity than its use to.

"334","I use this monitor for Photoshop, Premiere, and Revit as well as a couple game titles. Im very satisfied with the 100% RGB color configuration, the colors are very vivid. At 300cd the brightness is adequate. I often dim the screen at night and never brighten the screen to max. The stand is excellent, very durable, can tilt, raise and lower as well as turn the screen from landscape to portrait when editing large format portrait designs. At 60Hz you have to sacrifice motion blur if you play fast motion games but the 1440p is worth it over a 1080p 120Hz. The button controls are well placed on the bottom right. The large real estate is great for multitasking multiple windows. My only complaint is the placement of the power cord connection on the bottom because every month gravity does it toll and I have to push it back up when I think my screen died on me.For a while I was skeptical about purchasing a Korean brand WQHD high resolution screen for the extremely low prices. In the end I choose against it because I wouldnt be patient enough to hassle with RMAing a screen if it had defects even if I ordered a picture perfect. It seems hit or miss for people. I wanted a higher than 1080p resolution screen much like the Apple Cinema screens. Originally I wanted a glass screen but after some considerations on monitor placement with the huge amount of light coming into my entertainment room I decided that the glass and glossy screens would not be a suitable option due to glare. It may not be 2160p or 1600p but its a very noticeable improvement over 1080p, so much so that I have to upgrade my 1080p TV now. I wont touch a 2160p until theres an affordable and reliable IPS at 60Hz.Asus provides all the cables you need.

"336","Excellent, sharp, vivid images on the screen.  Using it in a dual monitor setup off of my 15"" late 2013 Retina Macbook Pro with a 27"" Apple Thunderbolt monitor.  In order to get the full 4K resolution, I had to connect it via the HDMI port on the MBP.  Mini displayport to displayport wouldn't work, whether from the second Thunderbolt port on the MBP, or when trying to daisy chain it off of the thunderbolt port on the Apple monitor.  To be certain it wasn't some setting or a cable I was using, I contacted Apple Support and they were the one that told me the only way to get the full 4K in my particular setup was via the HDMI port on the MBP.  Because the MBP is docked in a (vertical) Henge Dock, I even tried a Thunderbolt/Mini displayport to HDMI adapter rather than the HDMI port on the MPB itself in order to try to avoid having the HDMI cable plugged into the top of the MBP, but that wouldn't display at any resolution on the ASUS 4K monitor.  The ASUS monitor did support the thunderbolt/mini displayport to displayport IF the Apple thunderbolt monitor was NOT attached, but it (assuming it was a limitation of the Mac hardware/software) would not drive two ""displayport"" monitors at high resolution",1,7,6,8,87.5,12.5,"  excellent sharp vivid images   screen  using    dual monitor setup     late  retina macbook pro    apple thunderbolt monitor   order  get  full k resolution    connect  via  hdmi port   mbp  mini displayport  displayport wouldnt work whether   second thunderbolt port   mbp   trying  daisy chain     thunderbolt port   apple monitor    certain  wasnt  setting   cable   using  contacted apple support     one  told    way  get  full k   particular setup  via  hdmi port   mbp    mbp  docked   vertical henge dock  even tried  thunderboltmini displayport  hdmi adapter rather   hdmi port   mpb   order  try  avoid   hdmi cable plugged   top   mbp   wouldnt display   resolution   asus k monitor   asus monitor  support  thunderboltmini displayport  displayport   apple thunderbolt monitor   attached   assuming    limitation   mac hardwaresoftware   drive two displayport monitors  high resolution

"346","I was looking to buy a bigger monitor then my old 2407wfp 24"" Dell. I have been very happy with my Dell since buying it way back in 2006. I just wanted a bigger screen. 30"" screens look great but most cost over 1000. I started to look at 27"" screens and considered the Dell U2713HM and the Asus PA279Q both are more expensive. After looking at reviews and watching youtube reviews off all 3 I decided that I would get the Asus PB278Q. I can't say how this compares to those but I really like my PB278Q.Compared to the Dell (2407WFP) the screen is 3"" wider and only .5 inch taller. So not a world of difference in screen size. The Dell (2407WFP) being 16:10 and the Asus being 16:9. Maybe not the world of difference that I was expecting but still a very nice monitor and I have been very happy with it.I found one dead pixel and it really is hard to find most of the time. Even on a white screen I have to really look to find it. while playing games I never notice it. I have only played Empire total war, Sins of a solar empire and Civ V. I have not spent much time playing BF4 so far to give it a real review.I bought the MSI R9 290 Gaming card to use with this monitor replacing my old HD5850.

I found that the monitor was going blank and saying that there was no Display Port signal, especially when booting into Fedora. It also takes so long to for the thing to power up and get the actual display that my PC was well past grub and booting by the time I could see anything.

"355","For background..I'm driving this monitor with two GTX790s in SLI. Besides changing the display port to 1.2 to get 60hz, be sure you have ""Smart View"" turned off under ""Color"" on the monitor menu. If you don't do this, the display will look washed out. ""Smart View"" got turned on somehow, and I was very disappointed in the monitor. After turned it off and making other adjustments, I'm very pleased with the display.

This wasn't the small, random, flecks of dust that can accidentally end up in most monitors, even from a clean room.

Of course, there's no way to tell how many pixel anomalies were beyond all the dirt.Hopefully ASUS can correct this problem so future purchasers don't have to deal with it, but currently, be wary.",6,2,-4,8,25,75,"   monitor  purchased  returned   beginning  april    large amount  dirt  debris inside  screen  wasnt  small random flecks  dust  can accidentally end    monitors even   clean room      someone  left  plastic covering  front outside   day  dirt accumulated    someone took   pressed    front   screen sealing  inits  shame since  color temperature  light uniformity  spoton  course theres  way  tell  many pixel anomalies  beyond   dirthopefully asus can correct  problem  future purchasers dont   deal    currently  wary

For those of you who are heavy Excel users, this monitor is a game changer. Makes me eye the next crop of 4k monitors more closely.- I also use this monitor for gaming... primarily first person shooters (BF4 & TF2) and some League of Legends.

"377","Only had two issues.1. There was an intense amount of back light bleed coming from the bottom left corner of the screen, about a 5"" x 5"" area. I could press on the anti-glare cover and the back light bleed would go away. So it seemed as if the cover was not flat on the panel. So I cut a piece of plastic from one of the included DVI covers into a small L shape and stuck it in the corner, which removed almost all of the back light bleed in that area.2. This is a design flaw and really only affects people who mess with it a lot, which I do, several times a week. The DVI, and other, ports on the back of the monitor come out vertical, instead of horizontal out of the back like other monitors, and you really have to bend the cables hard.

"391","I bought this specifically for Photo Editing.As a first time IPS owner this monitor was an eye opener, after a quick calibration i did a side by side test with my Alienware OptX 120hz monitor (I use it for gaming) I always thought the colors were really good on the alienware, boy I was wrong. The difference is night and day. Color is outstanding.The one thing I miss is the ability to pan the monitor left and right, not a big deal at all, but the OptX I own does this, and I love that feature. This monitor does however go into portrait mode (although exagerated due to the 16:9 aspect ratio), very nice feature.Build quality is adequate. The base is plastic but weighted well enough, I dont see this being an issue down the road. If you want better build quality I would look into the Dell IPS, it costs more but they have sales for it all the time.My panel came with no inconsistent light bleed, but true blacks arent very black, even when calibrated. The contrast is fine, but true blacks are too washed out with backlight.the input lag from mouse to screen is quite noticeable. It actually affected my productivity but after a few weeks I started getting used to it.The resolution is such a luxury I feel like it's overkill sometimes. It makes 1920x1080 feel cramped when i drag windows to my alienware monitor. For photo editing it's been great for seeing details without pixel peeping. For web browsing I zoom the pages so I can read the text. (control + scroll).Ghosting is noticeable during games (smearing of text/images) but it's not terrible. Movies still look great, but gaming is not enjoyable on this monitor for me due to the ghosting and the input lag previously mentioned.Everything I reviewed is perfectly normal for IPS panels of this price range.

"395","Excellent monitor in all categories. The color quality is superb and you can really see everything as it was meant to be seen. Some monitors I've used in the past had overly bright whites or were just not as vibrant but this monitor has none of those issues. Even with the blue filter it has you can still see blues in a crisp manner without any distortion.After almost three months of having this monitor I can say that I have zero complaints about it. For the price and quality this is perhaps the best 4K monitor out there. Currently with the price of 32"" monitors you could buy almost three of these for the same price of a single 32"" so why even bother with them. The bezel is very small and you can easily run dual or triple monitor setups without loosing a lot of space to the thick bezels other monitors have.I had this monitor out of the box, VESA mounted, and running in just a couple minutes. About half of that time was spend admiring the monitor itself and unmounting my old monitor so this is very quick to get out of the package and start using right away. There is excellent package protection from Asus but they don't waste extra packaging where they don't need to suck as on the cables.",5,10,5,15,66.6666666666667,33.3333333333333,"  excellent monitor   categories  color quality  superb   can really see everything    meant   seen  monitors ive used   past  overly bright whites   just   vibrant   monitor  none   issues even   blue filter    can still see blues   crisp manner without  distortionafter almost three months    monitor  can say    zero complaints     price  quality   perhaps  best k monitor   currently   price   monitors   buy almost three      price   single    even bother    bezel   small   can easily run dual  triple monitor setups without loosing  lot  space   thick bezels  monitors havei   monitor    box vesa mounted  running  just  couple minutes  half   time  spend admiring  monitor   unmounting  old monitor     quick  get    package  start using right away   excellent package protection  asus   dont waste extra packaging   dont need  suck    cables

"397","This is a negative review for Asus changing their product without telling the consumer.  I expected to receive the monitor shown on the Amazon and Asus website, but Amazon appears to be shipping the PB278QR, or perhaps the PB278Q with the PB278QR On Screen Display & frame (my monitor version number is PB278Q with a manufacturing date of Jun 2014).  The PB278QR uses a different OSD than the PB278Q, which doesn't include User Mode.  Instead you get: Scenery Mode, Standard Mode, Theater Mode, Game Mode, Night View Mode, & sRGB Mode.  The monitor frame also has different icons above the buttons; you now get non-descriptive ""dots"" instead of picture icons above the menu buttons.I returned my first monitor, thinking that it was a manufacturing error, but the replacement monitor was exactly the same.  After wasting a bunch of time doing research, I finally found the PB278QR on the Asus website:  http://www.asus.com/Monitors_Projectors/PB278QR/overview/.  The PB278QR instruction manual matches the monitor I received.  I can't find any reviews on the PB278QR, and I'm not even sure that's what I have --- maybe it's just a PB278Q in PB278QR clothing.

"398","Bought two of these babies, they are beautiful. Despite being TN panels they are bright enough and the color gamut is lively enough to be easily viewed even though I have them positioned with a window directly behind them. The stand is fantastic, especially when you compare them to the Dell or Samsung offerings with the same panel. The extras are great and the 60Hz over Display Port puts this one above the competition though to get it to work you will have to navigate the menu (it is easy to navigate) and activate it and you may have to update a graphics driver. Having the equivalent of four 1080p screens per monitor is great for working on multiple documents and drawings while being able to monitor websites, email and social media. For UHD gaming this is the monitor of choice if you've got the graphics muscle to push the pixels. The screens are very responsive though Gaming mode hasn't made any noticeable difference in FPS, FPRPG, Action, Fighting, Simulation or Strategy. I tried these two out in Eyefinity but even with my high end crossfire setup it is a wee bit too much to handle effectively. Colors are almost good enough for professional photo/video editing/content creation but is certainly good enough for amateur/home efforts. The wide (for TN) viewing angles were a pleasant surprise as well. They are fantastic for drafting and other CAD type applications. The speakers are functional but nothing to write home about, though if you are an audiophile you're probably not planning on using them anyway.

"405","No ghosting problems or any other common problems read about on reviews. ASUS comes through with a great product as always...It's very bright and of course has settings to change that, it arrived without any dead pixels, and it functions great. It has 2 USB ports on the left and 2 on the bottom. It has speakers which I don't use but I tested them and they are decent. A Logitech c920 webcam fits fine on top of this monitor. The button placement is very good on this monitor, as apposed to most monitors where buttons are on the button and nearly impossible to press without using two hands because the monitor will move.Great for movies and gaming, I play Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory at 1920x1080 and I must say it's a very nice improvement from a 1680x1050 resolution I had with my previous monitor (Samsung SyncMaster 226BW). In general the resolution upgrade is great because of the work I do which commonly takes up the entire desktop. The colors look amazing, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this monitor. It came packaged very well in foam and included many cables. The light on the front panel indicating the monitor status is not one of those annoying lights that shines in your eyes or anything. One thing I wish this monitor had was backlights on the control buttons.Update 9/22/2013: I'm actually considering getting another of these monitors.

Was a little more than I wanted to spend, but less than I budgeted so I was content.It arrived well packaged, and the stand was something to behold.

Its flat, its solid, and the rubber feet keep it in place.The monitor itself is quite nice, visually speaking. Very crisp, I cannot make out individual pixels on it like I can on my other monitors.

"421","EDIT 2016-01-21:I requested a replacement unit from Amazon, and received it two days later (today). So far the replacement exhibits none of the pixel line issues that plagued my original unit. There appear to be settings in the OSD menu that were not there before (although I won't swear to that) so it could be a newer unit (or new firmware of some sort?). At this rate I'll bump my rating up to 4 stars since its a good monitor for a decent price.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I did a lot of research before purchasing this monitor, and it would overall be a great display - ergonomics are good, display is bright, response is perfectly acceptable, price is decent, lots of various inputs, etc etc.However my unit has very faint, but clearly visible ""pixel"" lines across the entire display. On black they appear as faint red lines between the black pixels (pic on left). My other monitor (an older Planar 27"") does not have such artifacts (pic on right), neither do any of the 24"" and various smaller displays I own.  I've changed the cables, changed computers, changed video cards, drivers, changed modes and various settings on the monitor itself. Turning off ASCR and increasing the brightness helps to an extent, but its always noticeable - and the longer you use it the more noticeable it is.Has anyone else noticed anything similar? Is this normal for this monitor, or did I just luck out and get a lemon? I was planning on getting another unit (so I had a matching pair) to replace my older monitor, but the lines are driving me nuts and I'm closer to returning this one than considering another purchase at this point.Pic on left is ASUS, pic on right is another monitor (without the issue).",6,11,5,17,64.7058823529412,35.2941176470588,"  edit  requested  replacement unit  amazon  received  two days later today  far  replacement exhibits none   pixel line issues  plagued  original unit  appear   settings   osd menu      although  wont swear        newer unit  new firmware   sort   rate ill bump  rating    stars since   good monitor   decent priceoriginal reviewi   lot  research  purchasing  monitor    overall   great display  ergonomics  good display  bright response  perfectly acceptable price  decent lots  various inputs etc etchowever  unit   faint  clearly visible pixel lines across  entire display  black  appear  faint red lines   black pixels pic  left   monitor  older planar      artifacts pic  right neither       various smaller displays    ive changed  cables changed computers changed video cards drivers changed modes  various settings   monitor  turning  ascr  increasing  brightness helps   extent   always noticeable    longer  use    noticeable  ishas anyone else noticed anything similar   normal   monitor    just luck   get  lemon   planning  getting another unit     matching pair  replace  older monitor   lines  driving  nuts  im closer  returning  one  considering another purchase   pointpic  left  asus pic  right  another monitor without  issue

Not a big deal for me, 'cuz I'm old and don't need more. (It can be bumped up to 75-85Hz or so via software, but you're not going to get 120Hz with this display.* No USB ports (not a biggie, but I've gotten used to having them)* Screen rotation (pivot) only works one direction, and even at the highest level, the corner of the screen hits the base unless you tilt it. Inconvenient if you want to frequently switch between horizontal and vertical orientations.

"434","Man. I really don't know why I pushed the purchases of this off for so long. I've been editing on a very high end 1080p monitor with 10-but, wide gamut color and 100% sRGB from ViewSonic. I did tons of research on monitors to come up with this one truly being the best monitor for the money without going nuts and spending double for very minimal true gains in real color accuracy and working consistency. So I get the monitor and, like all monitors, it ships in consumer settings that absolutely suck hard.

"435","I now own 6 of these monitors (5 all on the same PC). If WQHD(2560X1440) is what you're looking for, but don't want to pay a ton then this is an amazing option. The stand that comes with these monitors is amazing, it allows you to lift the monitor high enough to switch it to a portrait orientation if you wish. The screen quality is very nice - very rich, clean, and easy on the eyes. The only thing I don't like is the buttons for adjusting the monitors - they feel a little cheap and I don't like where they are placed, but the interface itself is easy to understand & navigate.The 5 monitors on one PC I purchased towards the end of 2015. One seems to be having a slight flicker problem, but I'm not convinced it's the monitor yet (I think it's the video card). The remaining 1 that I own I've had for nearly 2 years and it's still just as good as the day I purchased it - no problems whatsoever.1920X1080(Full HD) vs. 2560X1440(WQHD) -If you're used to using a full HD monitor then you would be amazed at how much extra room you get with a higher resolution. This is the key thing that drove me into buying these monitors. More resolution results in more room to work, but if the resolution gets too high (4K@27"" would be too high for me) vs. the size of the monitor then things become way too hard to read (at least for me). This to me makes the WQHD resolution perfect for work & productivity!As you can see, I'd buy this monitor again and again, but I think 6 will do for now.",5,15,10,20,75,25,"   now     monitors      pc  wqhdx   youre looking   dont want  pay  ton     amazing option  stand  comes   monitors  amazing  allows   lift  monitor high enough  switch    portrait orientation   wish  screen quality   nice   rich clean  easy   eyes   thing  dont like   buttons  adjusting  monitors   feel  little cheap   dont like    placed   interface   easy  understand  navigatethe  monitors  one pc  purchased towards  end   one seems     slight flicker problem  im  convinced   monitor yet  think   video card  remaining     ive   nearly  years   still just  good   day  purchased    problems whatsoeverxfull hd vs xwqhd  youre used  using  full hd monitor     amazed   much extra room  get   higher resolution    key thing  drove   buying  monitors  resolution results   room  work    resolution gets  high k    high   vs  size   monitor  things become way  hard  read  least      makes  wqhd resolution perfect  work  productivityas  can see id buy  monitor      think  will   now

"442","This will be a quick review, but in short, this monitor is wonderful for general-purpose usage.  I especially like it for reading, writing, and browsing, since the extra pixels really make the text much crisper.I fired up Skyrim on it at full resolution (2560x1440), and it looks phenomenal.  Since the pixel density is so high, even 2x anti-aliasing is sufficient (though you should still use 8x or higher anisotropic filtering).  But if your video card cannot hack it, the monitor lets you play at lower resolutions in letterbox mode.  Diablo III furthermore looks gorgeous at 2560x1440: you can see so much of the map!The colors are bright and clear, and the wide viewing angle, crisp text, and extra screen real-estate are great for productivity applications.  Also, the monitor stand is solid and allows easy adjustment of the height and viewing angle for maximum user comfort.  This high-end monitor is well worth the extra cost above a standard 1080p screen, which I have owned for years, if you have the cash to spend.

"448","UPDATE: After sending back the defective monitor and mulling over whether to try again or go with a different brand, I decided to test my luck and purchased this monitor again. The replacement I received is *significantly* better about color/temperature uniformity across the panel... the temperature shift I described below is still present (warm on the left, green/cool on the right), but it's much less pronounced and closer to neutral; I really have to look for it to notice it. It's good enough that I can live with it, and especially at the price, and this panel is just as good as the other one (no dead/stuck pixels, no noticeable light bleed).Despite the mixed reviews, I took a chance on this monitor, having had generally good success with many Asus products over the last decade. When I first received the monitor, I was pleased with the picture quality; backlight bleed is minimal (really almost none), no dead pixels, and colors seemed vibrant but well-defined.But, when I went to calibrate it for photo editing, I realized the panel has a *tremendous* discrepancy in temperature, from bottom-left to top-right. The left half of the panel is extremely warm, and the right half is very green. I've tried color profiles and calibration settings I've found online, but nothing accounts for such a drastic shift in temperature across the panel.This is really disappointing, since I think the main reason people get IPS-type panels is for color accuracy for photo/graphics work; I'm surprised Asus would sell this monitor without better quality control. My Dell U2715H has some heavy bleed around the edges (and later some dimming in spots, which is why I replaced it with this), but the panel temp was very consistent and very usable after calibration.

After receiving mine I can confirm there are no dead/stuck pixels, just an incredibly beautiful display.I've always owned 720 and 1080p panels in the past, so of course this one will look especially amazing. So how do I tell if it's a quality panel? Well, according to all the professional reviews i've read(and from the old eye test) this monitor ships with fairly accurate colors. With a little tinkering, you can have it looking fantastic in just a few minutes. sRGB mode means professionals can tune this thing to perfection with pinpoint accuracy. While I have not done this myself (I use this monitor solely for performance gaming) it's certainly a nice feature if I ever decide to professionally calibrate this thing. Asus includes their other staple presets like Standard(my choice for gaming), Theater, User, and the previously aforementioned sRGB mode. This monitor also features a ""trace-free"" mode which helps eliminate ghosting artifacts which, in my opinion, is a welcome addition that some of my older Asus monitors did not include.Since i'm not a professional graphic designer or anything like that I can't comment on performance in those areas but one area I can comment on is gaming. In a nutshell, this monitor is stunning while playing any modern PC game. I have specifically played Battlefield 3, Skyrim, Black Ops 2, Borderlands 2 and the Witcher 2 on max settings and the detail is nothing short of amazing. The extra pixels add a dimension in gaming that I simply have not experienced before. Textures are so crisp that Anti-Aliasing is not even required. My previous monitor was 120hz 2ms response time so I was a little concerned about ghosting/lag during intense online FPS play but i'm happy to report that isn't an issue here. Was my 120hz monitor somewhat smoother? Sure, but the discernable difference in minute. Gameplay feels very natural on this monitor.The one thing you will need to run games at max settings+2560x1440 resolutions is a monster graphics card. I have a GTX 680 2gb card and I can run all games on max with the exception of Anti-Aliasing. As I stated before AA isn't needed as much with the higher resolution but that doesn't mean it's not wanted/useless. I can usually get away with 2x or 4x MSAA(plus FXAA) but any more than that and my FPS drops below 35 and thus becomes unplayable for me. 3+ GB of VRAM is needed if you truly want to max games out at 1440p. Just something to consider for people looking at this monitor for high resolution gaming.The only real knock I have against this monitor is the button layout/menu control scheme. It can be quite annoying to try and navigate/change values because the arrow buttons aren't next to each other and the functions not clearly labeled. User options can be considered minimal compared to some other models out there(such as Samsung's monitors) but that's not too big a deal because it ships looking pretty decent already. This may be an issue for some, however.Overall I would recommend this monitor to just about everyone, and especially gamers like me. The price is fantastic compared to most on the market and the build quality is certainly better than the similarly priced korean models (although some may refute this, there is always something to be said about having a real warranty). Not only is the panel fantastic, but Asus also includes connectors of every kind in the box. That was certainly an added bonus for me.

"462","I feel scammed. After unsuccessfully spending an stressful half hour with phone support (case number N160418601) trying to solve my issue, since I felt that this email support was going nowhere, I ended up spending even more time deep searching online about my issue, finding out to my surprise that the monitor is not truly 10-bit, even though everywhere in Asus product overviews and specifications say otherwise. My graphics card can't set the monitor to 10-bit because it isn't existent. There are not even small letters at the bottom of the page telling the truth about it. You guys are advertising something false and I bought it. On top of that, I've spent time and energy trying to set things right and you guys have played along to this unsolvable issue.You guys have an 8-bit up-scaled to ""10-bit"" display that does the trick of looking ""good"". But that's not what I bought. I bought an UHD monitor with 10-bit color because that's exactly what I needed and that's what Asus sold me. Asus has given me instead a 8-bit display, a bunch of stress and time wasted.Buying this monitor was the perfect, smart and cost-effective solution to displaying and refining the UHD visual effects work I've been working many weeks on, expecting to rely on the 10-bit display to show me gradients and bright spots more accurately at a full-scale final output of 3840x2160. Instead, I see cramped gradients and bright colors being way off. At this moment I can only use this monitor to see things at full scale, and have to ignore how the bad the rest looks.Thanks for making me buy a false product.

"463","This monitor has several flaws that combine to make it a poor value for money. I purchased it as a third monitor so that I would have more screen real estate for software development. It compares very poorly both to my HP LP2475w and my older Dell E248WFP.First, its color accuracy is atrocious. Even after trying the color calibration found on Tom's Hardware's review of this monitor, and after trying many different combinations, I still feel that the color accuracy for red is way off. Reds display as oranges or yellows. My HP monitor, which is intended for professional color accuracy, displays an excellent true red, but even the less saturated red that my nothing-special-Dell monitor produces with default settings is superior to anything achievable on this ASUS. Also, each display preset gives the overall screen either a very yellowish hue or a blue overcast, with nothing in-between; none of the presets render a satisfactory ""white.""The other major problem is sharpness, which may be related to the screen size (28"" widescreen) simply being too small for a 4k monitor. (My fault for buying it.) The monitor is torn between two unacceptable conditions: the sharpness setting turned down, which results in fuzzy, unreadable text, or the sharpness setting turned up to about 60, which makes text readable, but destroys video game graphics and photos.Each of the display presets has a tradeoff, whether it introduces aliasing to graphics (due to the sharpness setting), insults colors, blurs text as though you are underwater, or is simply far too dim. This might be less frustrating if each preset allowed all of its settings to be changed, but certain settings are disabled with certain presets. The placement of the buttons on the back of the monitor is also very unfortunate - it makes the buttons hard to line up with the on-screen icons, and it hurt my hand after a while trying to change the settings.I am probably going to send this unit back and do more research (not just reading customer reviews) before attempting another purchase.",17,5,-12,22,22.7272727272727,77.2727272727273,"   monitor  several flaws  combine  make   poor value  money  purchased    third monitor       screen real estate  software development  compares  poorly    hp lpw   older dell ewfpfirst  color accuracy  atrocious even  trying  color calibration found  toms hardwares review   monitor   trying many different combinations  still feel   color accuracy  red  way  reds display  oranges  yellows  hp monitor   intended  professional color accuracy displays  excellent true red  even  less saturated red   nothingspecialdell monitor produces  default settings  superior  anything achievable   asus also  display preset gives  overall screen either   yellowish hue   blue overcast  nothing inbetween none   presets render  satisfactory whitethe  major problem  sharpness  may  related   screen size  widescreen simply   small   k monitor  fault  buying   monitor  torn  two unacceptable conditions  sharpness setting turned   results  fuzzy unreadable text   sharpness setting turned      makes text readable  destroys video game graphics  photoseach   display presets   tradeoff whether  introduces aliasing  graphics due   sharpness setting insults colors blurs text  though   underwater   simply far  dim  might  less frustrating   preset allowed    settings   changed  certain settings  disabled  certain presets  placement   buttons   back   monitor  also  unfortunate   makes  buttons hard  line    onscreen icons   hurt  hand    trying  change  settingsi  probably going  send  unit back    research  just reading customer reviews  attempting another purchase

"469","--The product:Amazing picture, great build quality, great I/O, amazing product for the money. I really want another one or two for my multipurpose setup, it's a matter of time. The only recommendation to Asus is that these ship in DisplayPort 1.2 mode instead of 1.1. I am currently on my second week of my replacement monitor with no issues. The first product shipped to me with a cluster of bad pixels that I discovered on day one, no big deal, no sweat, it happens. Amazon is the way to go because I received my replacement before I got a chance to ship back the first one. The build quality of this guy makes me feel like it will last a decade, which is what I value most in a display. Function over form is the idea behind this monitor's stand and bezel.The hue/tone of this display is warming and a bit more yellow than your average display but I personally prefer it over an LED blue tinted white. It can be adjusted and compensated for anyway. The viewing angles are definitely not the best but have not bugged me either. If you plan on using this off to the side frequently, then you may wish for a different panel. For me, since the stand is super, freaking adjustable I never have to worry about viewing angles.--The concept and technology:4K is still sort of an experimental, grease-monkey technology in the PC world. You'll need to do some research before you jump in, or you could find yourself puzzled by terrible performance. You will need to run display port to use full 4K, otherwise you're stuck in 30fps refresh rate which is a world of hurt, don't do it. For gaming at full 4K you will need to fork out a little bit for a decent GPU. While a GTX 760 was amazing for 1080p it does not stand a chance in 4K, and 4Gig VRAM is minimum.This monitor actually pushed me into using my free Windows 8 upgrade because Windows 7 just doesn't scale as well as I'd hope to this pixel density. Certain text just wouldn't scale right and be as readable in 4K 28inch. Windows 8 handles it so much better when you bump some of the scaling and text sizes. I also understand that Windows 10 is supposed to make it even smoother a transition.This is the size you want for media, pictures, and gaming... I will never want to go back to 1080p resolution. This size and resolution is the sweet spot, especially for gaming. You won't find much video or any movies out there in 4K yet but that's a whole different story.If you want normal, readable text but don't want to scale everything up, you'll want a screen bigger than this. Of course if you just more screen real estate you might as well just get a bunch of normal resolution monitors, and you can buy three of these for the price of one 32inch version. Never the less, the real estate is still a massive boost as it is for every type of use.

"470","[edit ***]The monitor was still under warranty, so was able to send it for repair. I think I got a different physical unit [a couple extra dead pixels]. This mostly worked out well, except I had to ship the thing across the country at my own expense. Shipping + packing cost me over $100. So the warranty worked, ASUS fixed the problem, I still like the device.[original review **]Bought this monitor in July of 2013 for over $550, which was a good price at the time. The monitor had a dead pixel or two on arrival but that doesn't bother me. It was otherwise well constructed and did the job. Since the beginning of 2015 I noticed that one of the physical buttons went dead. It was annoying because I couldn't navigate the menu, but wasn't a huge deal becuase my settings were ok. Since the beginning of 2016 seems like that button is sending a random signal. The monitor now cycles through its modes [standard/scenery/theater] randomly, sometimes in rapid succession. Means the monitor is basically unusable.

"474","I chose this monitor because i was looking for an IPS panel, 23in or bigger with a reasonable budget. Price-wise the monitor is incredibly attractive and I've been positively surprise by the build quality and the package.The monitor comes together with an extremely complete sets of cables, including a display port cable, that i was not expecting to be included (note: hdmi is not included, if you plan to connect to hdmi remember to buy one. Go with an el-cheapo one, doesn't make any difference).Build quality is excellent, plastics are very nice and the mount is really top notch: every movement (tilt, rotate and height adjustment) is extremely smooth and allow a quick and accurate orientation. If you have a narrow desk take a couple of extra measurements because the stand is significantly deeper than your usual consumer grade monitor.Image is really good, no banding at all (I've tried to do some color gradients in Photoshop and they came out very smooth, without artifacts or posterization), some light leak from the lower part of the bezel, but nothing too obnoxious.Speakers are fine: i like the fact that, being placed somewhere behind the panel, they give the illusion that the sound is coming from the screen itself (that makes videoconferencing extremely pleasant). One single negative point, adjusting the volume is not so quick, you need to push a couple of buttons and there is no mute option... better to leave it on a value and use windows controls for thatIn very few words: strongly recommended, very nice product",3,17,14,20,85,15,"   chose  monitor    looking   ips panel   bigger   reasonable budget pricewise  monitor  incredibly attractive  ive  positively surprise   build quality   packagethe monitor comes together   extremely complete sets  cables including  display port cable     expecting   included note hdmi   included   plan  connect  hdmi remember  buy one go   elcheapo one doesnt make  differencebuild quality  excellent plastics   nice   mount  really top notch every movement tilt rotate  height adjustment  extremely smooth  allow  quick  accurate orientation     narrow desk take  couple  extra measurements   stand  significantly deeper   usual consumer grade monitorimage  really good  banding   ive tried    color gradients  photoshop   came   smooth without artifacts  posterization  light leak   lower part   bezel  nothing  obnoxiousspeakers  fine  like  fact   placed somewhere behind  panel  give  illusion   sound  coming   screen   makes videoconferencing extremely pleasant one single negative point adjusting  volume    quick  need  push  couple  buttons     mute option better  leave    value  use windows controls  thatin   words strongly recommended  nice product

"475","I did a lot of researching about these 1440p monitors and their prices. I was really considering getting one of those incredably priced Korean monitors. However, after reading inumerous reviews i thought it was too much of a lottery ordering one of those.

Excellent build quality ( even though its all plastic, it all feels very sturdy and all in its place) and the panel is absolutly amazing.

"489","I am very impressed with this ASUS monitor not only because of it's beautiful display but also the mechanical and electronic adjustments just feel right, like a well designed monitor.  The display controls are easy to use and very intuitive.  Tilt, swivel and height are smooth and easy to accomplish without struggling. In the 2560x1440 resolution mode 4K program material and even 1080p look amazing on a 27"" screen.  The built-in speakers sound considerably better than the very inexpensive USB pair I had been using, but of course they cannot be expected to compete with high priced sound systems.

"490","Fantastic picture, miserable sound.  How much more would it cost manufacturer to increase speaker wattage by 2 lousy watts?  Typical and ridiculously low standard in monitor speakers by ALL manufacturers, not just Asus.  The base is quite heavy (solid metal, it seems) which is a safety feature against accidental tipover, I guess.  Easy to set up and start, but hidden buttons on the back are really stupid and take some getting used to.I got a 4k for gaming, but if you get this to do that be reminded that you need a big graphics card and possibly other support to make it work, although the picture does improve noticeably even without it (depending on what you have now).  I was using a 1080p TV (6 ms response time) as a monitor with a gtx 770 card in my computer and the picture and action was pretty good in Fallout 3.  Soon after buying this Asus monitor I swapped that card for a gtx 970 and the gaming went from pretty good to utterly incredible.  Neither monitor nor card are cheap, but it's a big step up in imaging and response time.

"498","Just received this monitor today.  Previously had a nice Dell 27-inch 1080P monitor, but found at that size with that resolution, the pixels were too large (the pixel density was too low for me).  Also it was a glossy screen and bezel, which I found very frustrating due to constant glare.  This ASUS monitor offers higher resolution at the same size, and thus greater pixel density.  The difference is clear as day.  It's gentler on my eyes due to this, and the colors are true and crisp.  There are no dead pixels.  It came with one of every cable it supports!  (One HDMI, one DisplayPort, one DVI-D, one VGA, one power cable, and one 1/8"" audio cable.)  The included monitor stand is quite nice: It supports rotating the monitor 90 degrees, tilt, and several inches of height adjustment (on my previous Dell monitor I'd had to have it on a separate stand in order to have it tall enough; not necessary with the ASUS!).The only ""negatives"" I can say at this point are nits.  The included power cable is pretty short.  It will be fine for most people but if you want to hide the cables, you might need a longer one to allow you to run it where you want.  The other concern is that the location on the monitor where the cables are connected is very close to the bezel.  The connector on my DVI cable was very nearly too thick to be attached to the monitor.  There simply isn't much room between the connector and the bezel.  I did manage to get it connected, but there's no reason this should even be an issue.  ASUS should move the connectors away from the bezel by a few millimeters and it would not be a problem.",7,9,2,16,56.25,43.75,"  just received  monitor today  previously   nice dell inch p monitor  found   size   resolution  pixels   large  pixel density   low    also    glossy screen  bezel   found  frustrating due  constant glare   asus monitor offers higher resolution    size  thus greater pixel density   difference  clear  day   gentler   eyes due     colors  true  crisp     dead pixels   came  one  every cable  supports  one hdmi one displayport one dvid one vga one power cable  one  audio cable   included monitor stand  quite nice  supports rotating  monitor  degrees tilt  several inches  height adjustment   previous dell monitor id       separate stand  order    tall enough  necessary   asusthe  negatives  can say   point  nits   included power cable  pretty short   will  fine   people    want  hide  cables  might need  longer one  allow   run    want    concern    location   monitor   cables  connected   close   bezel   connector   dvi cable   nearly  thick   attached   monitor   simply isnt much room   connector   bezel    manage  get  connected  theres  reason   even   issue  asus  move  connectors away   bezel    millimeters       problem

"499","Before buying this monitor, I read all the reviews, both here and at other vendors.  I find that buyer's reviews are the best, because they don't accept advertising, and they are not compensated (however, since this is a favorable review, I could with good conscience  accept a bribe...lol!).  The monitor arrived today and replaces a 22"" TFT monitor.  I bought it primarily for the rave reviews of its color rendition.  Assembly and setup was simple.  Out of the box, the display is spectacular, as attested by many previous reviewers.  When I started Lightroom and Photoshop, I was amazed at the detail in my pictures that I had been missing.  This is pretty much a repeat of most of the previous reviews, except for one thing.  I have been using an AMD 6800 series video card in my pc, and ordered a new GTX 660 because I was assured by the reviewers that I would need at least a 7000 series or 600 and above series video card to display the 2560x1440 resolution.

"508","This is a very high quality monitor with a beautiful display.  Recently I ungraded to a HP H9-1170 computer with a 2560x1440 hd graphic card.  So I purchased this monitor and also the Nixeus 2560X1440 monitor to match my new computer.  This ASUS monitor arrived today.  It was easy to set up and the color looks good out of box.I am a glamour photographer and collects photos of beautiful models.  This monitor makes the models glow and look great.  The models look sharp crisp and pops out.  I noticed details I donot see with my previous 1920x1080 monitors. The OSD is easy to use to change settings.  For best photos I suggest one set sharpness, brightness and contrast to 100%.  Saturation and hue to 50%.  The next trick is to set temperature to cool otherwise the models skin tone will look too red.  I made all these settings while watching my favorite slide show, that way I know exactly the results will be to my liking.  Remember you must choose user mode in order to be out of the standard modes and make you own choices for settings.  By the way the screen is perfect and black is real black, white real white.This monitor has a semi gloss screen.  It is not thick as to affect sharpness and does not create a fog over black  as some heavily coated matte screen.  I am holding my final judgement on the coating.  All things equal I prefer glossy screens.  Pictures always look sharper in a glossy screen. Waiting for the arrival of the Nixeus monitor which has a glossy screen.  I will put both monitors side by side to make an AB comparison. Will update my evaluation at that time.11/29/2012My Nixeus hd 2560 monitor shipping was delayed to Dec 12 so I can not able to do my semi glossy and glossy screen test.

"517","Really enjoying this monitor since I got it despite 2 noticeable issues that have been obnoxious but bearable. The first is that the display port in the  monitor itself is not very good. The slightest shaking or moving of the monitor and the video image is lost. I have to jiggle the cable, no matter what kind of cable I use, close my eyes and pray and most of the time I can get the connection reestablished. The second problem seems to be a firmware problem with this monitor. Whenever the monitor hibernates when you first get it the display port connection is lost again! You have to go into the UEFI settings on your motherboard and make some adjustments to the low power settings to fix this. Fixing that was quick and fairly easy but it's still obnoxious that you have to do this kind of fiddling with this monitor just to make the display port image work properly. Everything else is awesome including: the zero backlight bleed (something that I've never seen with an IPS panel before), no glossy bezels and screen so no heavy reflection from other lights on your screen, the image itself and color representation, the stable and ergonomic stand, and the adjustable screen angles.

"518","Let me first start off by saying I love this monitor, it looks fantastic. However, shortly after purchasing the monitor, the monitor would not wake up if it was put to sleep for an extended period of time. This was happening on and off for about a month and a half. I ignored the problem as it was only happening with the Display Port. At first I thought it was my Custom PC. I thought perhaps the graphics card was acting out and I changed a bunch of settings in my BIOS. Nothing helped. I was getting SOOOOO frustrated because it would only turn back on whenever it felt like it. Today, I figured out that it was the actual monitor after attempting to connect my Macbook using a Mini Displayport -> Displayport cable. The Macbook wasn't being recognized either, so I knew it wasn't a computer related or GPU issue. After resetting the monitor, by unplugging it, the display port signal was recognized again. Is this a serious problem? YES.....Is it an annoying one that lowers the quality of the monitor for me significantly, YES. Minus this enormous defect, this is a fantastic monitor with bright and vivid colors. It is a shame that for $450 we still have these kind of issues though.

"524","Received this monitor early Wednesday. I spent all day trying to get it to work properly.First, it took over two hours for my PC to even recognize that the PB287 as a device was connected to it via the Displayport cable included in the box. I checked and rechecked the DP connection to my monitor and to my GPUS. I tediously switched which GPU I plugged the DP into a few times (turning everything off each time) each time not succeeding.I tried many times to switch to the display through Nvidia Control panel and Windows itself before it finally recognized it AND switched over on its own.I know it might sound like I have no idea what I am talking about, but I also have a 120hz and a 1440p IPS monitors, and am quite familiar with this simple and basic procedure. There is something wrong here.When I finally got the monitor to display an image, I went into the cumbersome menu and activated DP 1.2 for 60hz 4K. I tried out a few games for about 30 minutes. Here are the positives I can say in this brief time on my SLi 780Ti PC:The image quality is astounding, and this is coming from someone who already had a 1440p IPS. I was still floored all the same. Even better, there is virtually no ghosting in fast-moving images or first person perspectives thanks to it being a TN panel instead of IPS. Motion is FAR smoother with the PB287 in comparison. Every game I tested with zero AA of any kind had smoother edges  than 1440p with 4XMSAA. Maybe even 8xMSAA. The pixel density is a beauty to behold.Also, and I have no idea why, Watch Dogs plays more smoothly at 4K than it did in 1440p. I used the same exact settings with each monitor (other than turning the Temporal SMAA off in 4k, which is very low AA setting anyways) with High Textures/LOD, Ultra Water, etc. and not only it looks far sharper, there is FAR less stutter. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of fps drops, sometimes in the high 30s, but mostly 45-60 even in dense areas with much havok going on.Shortly after testing Watch Dogs and a few other games, the left half of my screen flickered white very fast before resuming that half of the image that was on the screen prior. From then on, in every game I tested (both using Vsync on and off in each title) I had a horizontal ""line"" going down the middle of the screen. Moving the camera around, the image would tear along this invisible line, like the left half of the monitor was out of synch with the right half by a fraction of a second.This screen-tearing is very similar to playing without Vsync, except it is horizontal instead of vertical, and it is persistent. Not a moment goes by without the tearing occurring. This is how every other moment I had playing today went for hours straight, and it isn't only during games. Closing a fullscreen tab in my browser results in the same thing: The left half is a half second delayed in revealing what is underneath it compared to the right side. The ""crease"" is exactly where the screen-tearing occurs during gaming.Resetting my PC cleared the issue for 5-10 minutes each try, but the white flicker followed by horizontal tearing comes back each time. Then my PC stopped recognizing the monitor. I rolled back from the latest Nvidia Driver to the second newest. More hours of testing without getting it to be recognized. This lasted for most of the rest of the day, me trying in vain to get it back. Finally, got it working for an hour (while tolerating the tearing) it lost connection AGAIN.Some thoughts:This is not 1ms response time. It is way better than a 1440p IPS in regards to input lag, but still no where near 1ms. I feel this being marketed in such a way is quite simply a lie.The ""line"" going right down the middle and the left side being slightly out of sync with the right side seems like something that could happen with slightly older 4K monitors that were two 30hz panels each requiring a separate HDMI cable being ""stitched together"" to comprise the monitor. But the PB287 is described in many reviews as one of the first 4k monitors with a unified panel. Surely ASUS isn't lying, but this is still weird.Major issues getting the monitor to communicate with my PC. Strange severe image issues. Probably just a bad DP cable, right? I only have the one that came in the box. I start thinking I would actually pay money to buy another one just to be done with this whole ordeal....but then I see 35 PB287 reviewers on another retailer's site where the vast majority are having connection issues and horizontal tearing just like me. Many claim to hear a loud popping sound coming from their units as well. I play with headphones on, so it is possible and maybe that happened to mine? Anyways, one of the reviewers claimed to have tried four different DP cables and none of them fixed his issues that are identical to mine. So I will not throw money at the wind trying to replace the DP cable the monitor came with.I will be contacting Amazon Customer Support after I wake up later on. I am far too tired of messing with this all day to wait in queue right now. I will be seeking a refund and not a replacement due to the number of early reports make me think it is a widespread issue at the core of the product.I will update the review and score after this gets resolved, but I cannot recommend this monitor under any condition right now.",27,27,0,54,50,50,"  received  monitor early wednesday  spent  day trying  get   work properlyfirst  took  two hours   pc  even recognize   pb   device  connected   via  displayport cable included   box  checked  rechecked  dp connection   monitor    gpus  tediously switched  gpu  plugged  dp    times turning everything   time  time  succeedingi tried many times  switch   display  nvidia control panel  windows    finally recognized   switched    owni know  might sound like    idea    talking    also   hz   p ips monitors   quite familiar   simple  basic procedure   something wrong herewhen  finally got  monitor  display  image  went   cumbersome menu  activated dp   hz k  tried    games    minutes    positives  can say   brief time   sli ti pcthe image quality  astounding    coming  someone  already   p ips   still floored    even better   virtually  ghosting  fastmoving images  first person perspectives thanks     tn panel instead  ips motion  far smoother   pb  comparison every game  tested  zero aa   kind  smoother edges   p  xmsaa maybe even xmsaa  pixel density   beauty  beholdalso     idea  watch dogs plays  smoothly  k     p  used   exact settings   monitor   turning  temporal smaa   k    low aa setting anyways  high textureslod ultra water etc     looks far sharper   far less stutter dont get  wrong   plenty  fps drops sometimes   high s  mostly  even  dense areas  much havok going onshortly  testing watch dogs     games  left half   screen flickered white  fast  resuming  half   image     screen prior     every game  tested  using vsync      title    horizontal line going   middle   screen moving  camera around  image  tear along  invisible line like  left half   monitor    synch   right half   fraction   secondthis screentearing   similar  playing without vsync except   horizontal instead  vertical    persistent   moment goes  without  tearing occurring    every  moment   playing today went  hours straight   isnt   games closing  fullscreen tab   browser results    thing  left half   half second delayed  revealing   underneath  compared   right side  crease  exactly   screentearing occurs  gamingresetting  pc cleared  issue   minutes  try   white flicker followed  horizontal tearing comes back  time   pc stopped recognizing  monitor  rolled back   latest nvidia driver   second newest  hours  testing without getting    recognized  lasted     rest   day  trying  vain  get  back finally got  working   hour  tolerating  tearing  lost connection againsome thoughtsthis   ms response time   way better   p ips  regards  input lag  still   near ms  feel   marketed    way  quite simply  liethe line going right   middle   left side  slightly   sync   right side seems like something   happen  slightly older k monitors   two hz panels  requiring  separate hdmi cable  stitched together  comprise  monitor   pb  described  many reviews  one   first k monitors   unified panel surely asus isnt lying    still weirdmajor issues getting  monitor  communicate   pc strange severe image issues probably just  bad dp cable right     one  came   box  start thinking   actually pay money  buy another one just   done   whole ordealbut   see  pb reviewers  another retailers site   vast majority   connection issues  horizontal tearing just like  many claim  hear  loud popping sound coming   units  well  play  headphones     possible  maybe  happened  mine anyways one   reviewers claimed   tried four different dp cables  none   fixed  issues   identical  mine   will  throw money   wind trying  replace  dp cable  monitor came withi will  contacting amazon customer support   wake  later    far  tired  messing    day  wait  queue right now  will  seeking  refund    replacement due   number  early reports make  think    widespread issue   core   producti will update  review  score   gets resolved    recommend  monitor   condition right now

"529","Before I order this 4k monitor, I ordered a Monoprice 30"" LED - after using this monitor for a while, I'm so glad that I made the right decision to return the Monoprice and get this instead.First of all, 4k monitor is so clear! I use this along side with my 2014 15"" mbp with Retina display. The monitor is connected to MBP using a MiniDisplayport-to-Displayport cable. This cable supports DisplayPort 1.2 so I can use the 4k monitor at full resolution (3840x2160)@60Hz. In my opinion, the monitor delivers similar quality compare to the Retina. Regarding the color, since I'm a software developer not a graphics designer, I'm fairly happy with the color and brightness.Outside of work, I also use this monitor to play games. The response rate (1ms according to advertisement) is pretty good and I do not notice any lag.However, there are two things I think the monitor can be improved:1. Factory setting by default uses display port 1.1 which support UHD 4k @ 30hz only. I had to go into the monitor OSD to manually change it to 1.2. It's disappointing that the monitor couldn't auto detect it.2. I set the monitor resolution to 1920x1080 for my desktop (Raedon 290x) when I'm playing games. At 60hz the display content didn't zoom to full screen. I had to modify my display driver settings to set the refresh rate to 50hz for it to show full screen. Personally I'm fine with 50hz since I use my desktop to play games only.After all, I would definitely recommend this 4k monitor.",1,15,14,16,93.75,6.25,"    order  k monitor  ordered  monoprice  led   using  monitor    im  glad   made  right decision  return  monoprice  get  insteadfirst   k monitor   clear  use  along side     mbp  retina display  monitor  connected  mbp using  minidisplayporttodisplayport cable  cable supports displayport    can use  k monitor  full resolution xhz   opinion  monitor delivers similar quality compare   retina regarding  color since im  software developer   graphics designer im fairly happy   color  brightnessoutside  work  also use  monitor  play games  response rate ms according  advertisement  pretty good     notice  laghowever   two things  think  monitor can  improved factory setting  default uses display port   support uhd k  hz     go   monitor osd  manually change     disappointing   monitor couldnt auto detect   set  monitor resolution  x   desktop raedon x  im playing games  hz  display content didnt zoom  full screen    modify  display driver settings  set  refresh rate  hz    show full screen personally im fine  hz since  use  desktop  play games onlyafter    definitely recommend  k monitor

I will note that you need to use the Display Port in order to get the WQHD, which i was not initially aware of, but it comes with the cable so as long as you have a video card with that port you should be good to go as long as you have a Display Port on your graphics card.But that one piece out of the way, this monitor is AMAZING!

The colors are vibrant and it looks simple. It has VESA-compatible mounting options and the stand it comes with is fully adjustable. Because it is an IPS monitor, the viewing angles are very good.

It's decent for games, but if you're looking for something with minimal lag and response times, then this probably isn't the best choice. At 60Hz, it also doesn't have the best refresh rate.

"558","Great monitor, especially for the price. Like having 4 monitors in one -- SO much screen real estate. The image is sharp, it has good color quality, and the swivel mount is really solidly constructed, making it super-easy to change the height, tilt, and orientation. That last is really good for doing programming/development work -- put the monitor into portrait mode, and now you can see many more lines of code.

"559","I've had this monitor since July 10, and I absolutely love it. I first wanted the PG278Q 1440P monitor that has GSYNC along with 144hz, but ASUS kept on pushing the release date back. I got a very good deal on this one, so I had to jump on it. The monitor had no problems with dead pixels. I prefer to use the scenery mode when gaming. I have 2 EVGA GTX 780 6GB in SLI, and they run perfectly at 1440p, with most games hitting above 60FPS. Because of this, I tried overclocking the monitor to 80hz. So far it was stable, but it became a little glitchy in games. However, I'm becoming worried it will ruin my monitor, so I backed it down to 60hz. Now, for the speakers. I personally believe they are 100% fantastic. Everything sounds so crisp to me, and they are very loud at max volume. From other reviews, I see people with the average ""they are monitor speakers... what else did you expect"" type of review. Of course they aren't $300 external speakers, but they are dang close to it. I have no complaint about the speakers.I have 2 cons (maybe 3)- when I first received the monitor, it kept telling me that the display port was getting no signal. This would happen about 3 times a day. I contacted support, and they kept trying to help me, but failed. Repeatedly told me it's a hardware issue and that I need to RMA it. Then about 3 weeks ago, I figured out the problem. For some reason, you need to turn the monitor on first, before the computer. If the computer is on first, it will get ""NO SIGNAL, and immediately go into standby mode. I'm very unhappy about this. This shouldn't happen on a $500 purchase.The second con is the backlight bleed. The top corners are decent, but the bottom 2 corners are absolutely terrible. I didn't want to do a return, so I just kept it. For spending close to $500 (after the price drops, I believe it was around $700 when I was first released), I wasn't satisfied with the ASUS quality control.One very little con is the size of the bezel. If I don't decide on getting the ROG Swift, I would like to add 2 more PB278Q's for NVIDIA SURROUND. The bezel is pretty thick, so it's going to be tough to look at 2 huge lines in the middle. But this is a possibility... Not sure if I will get 2 more.Overall I'm very satisfied with the monitor, let alone 1440p. I'm coming from a 19"" Visio TV (1080p), and the upgrade is great. But I'll be honest... It's very hard to tell the difference between 1080p and 1440p when gaming. ASUS Quality Control on this monitor isn't the best. I'm still very unsatisfied with the black light bleed and the ""NO SIGNAL""",15,19,4,34,55.8823529411765,44.1176470588235,"  ive   monitor since july    absolutely love   first wanted  pgq p monitor   gsync along  hz  asus kept  pushing  release date back  got   good deal   one     jump    monitor   problems  dead pixels  prefer  use  scenery mode  gaming    evga gtx  gb  sli   run perfectly  p   games hitting  fps     tried overclocking  monitor  hz  far   stable   became  little glitchy  games however im becoming worried  will ruin  monitor   backed    hz now   speakers  personally believe    fantastic everything sounds  crisp       loud  max volume   reviews  see people   average   monitor speakers  else   expect type  review  course  arent  external speakers    dang close      complaint   speakersi   cons maybe    first received  monitor  kept telling    display port  getting  signal   happen   times  day  contacted support   kept trying  help   failed repeatedly told    hardware issue    need  rma     weeks ago  figured   problem   reason  need  turn  monitor  first   computer   computer   first  will get  signal  immediately go  standby mode im  unhappy    shouldnt happen    purchasethe second con   backlight bleed  top corners  decent   bottom  corners  absolutely terrible  didnt want    return   just kept   spending close     price drops  believe   around     first released  wasnt satisfied   asus quality controlone  little con   size   bezel   dont decide  getting  rog swift   like  add   pbqs  nvidia surround  bezel  pretty thick   going   tough  look   huge lines   middle     possibility  sure   will get  moreoverall im  satisfied   monitor let alone p im coming    visio tv p   upgrade  great  ill  honest   hard  tell  difference  p  p  gaming asus quality control   monitor isnt  best im still  unsatisfied   black light bleed    signal

It also comes with every type of cable for the ports provided on this monitor, which means that you won't have to buy one in case the occasions calls for it.Cons: As previously mentioned by other reviewers, it has back-light bleeds, which are mostly noticeable on black scenes. The slight back-light bleed on my unit is located on the top left and bottom right of the screen, other than that it is working perfectly. Since the back-light bleed is a known issue and also not that noticeable, I didn't decide on doing an RMA since, I might get a replacement which is worse than the new one I have bought.

"567","I purchased this monitor, for general home use, to upgrade an Asus ML228H that was 2 1/2 yrs. old . I purchased the Used-Like New unit and it is like new.( At the time I also saved $40 over new but the price has gone up recently). Many of the features are the same or similar. I like the vertical adjustment of this model and the stability of the stand. I don't find the ""utilitarian appearance"" bothersome. In fact, I like the clean simple lines. I also prefer the pushbuttons rather than the touch buttons as they were easy to activate by accident, since you didn't actually have to touch them. The mfg. choice of which buttons to use may have to do with the stability of the stand. I am not a tech savvy person but to my eye this monitor is significantly better. It is sharper, cleaner and the colors really pop. I went to the Microsoft wallpaper web site and installed Splattered Paint Pots found under Arts(photographic). The colors are amazing! I didn't have to make any adjustments out of the box to suit my taste, which was nice. This model also has a more HD image, which I like. I don't notice any light bleeding or similar issues.

"590","I absolutely love this monitor for playing games in beautiful 4K. I do foresee a major graphics card update in my future.Pros- Full 4K over DP- Much better colors when compared to other TN panels. Definitely not an IPS though.- Amazing response time for gaming (1ms).- Cool running temp because of the LED Backlighting.- I can't comment on the stand too much as I'm using my own VESA mount. But from the videos and my brief look at it, it is definitely an upgrade from Samsungs equivalent. Not to mention when compared to other standard computer screen mounts.Major Cons- The light-bleed on the edges of the screen is a unacceptable for the price range this monitor is in. My 3+ year old >$200 LED and lamp back-lit monitors don't have close to any bleeding. It's not noticeable in typical gameplay, but if you plan to watch any fullscreen movie or YouTube video, it's definitely disappointing to see. You even get some dark shadows on the edges on a full white screen.- The buttons - the button placement is horrid when going through the UI. I dread ever having to use the menu. If you're using it for 4K, you almost have to because for some reason ASUS chooses the lesser 30hz over 4k setting when using it through DP.- Default settings - Make the 4K setting at 60hz by default. That's what most people are going to be using the monitor for.

"592","The following was my original statement.****I have returned two of these monitors now.  One had the OSD permanently stuck on, and none of the buttons worked.  It also had scratches on the screen everywhere.The second had a scratch on the screen and 4 stuck pixels.I have a sneaking suspicion Asus is using low grade panels.  I have had 5 or so ultrasharps and all have been perfect.  I will pay the premium for the better Dell panels from now on.  At least they have someone look them over before they ship them.Avoid this monitor, and pay more for one with decent quality control.****Edit: I ordered a Dell Ultrasharp 2713HM after writing the above, and it had the same problems.  I ordered one more of these, and for now, it is perfect.  It took 3 tries, but I finally have a good PB278Q.  Now that I have had a chance to use it extensively, I can give some pros and cons.Pros:-Very good picture quality-Comes with every display input-Lower response time than the Dell (slightly noticeable)-I prefer the coating on this monitor.  It's the perfect balance between matte and glossy.-Cheaper than the Ultrasharp 2713HM-3rd panel seems perfect on first inspectionCons:-Stand is terrible.  It has adjustments, but they are all awkward.  It slides all over the desk.-No ""real"" cable management.  The thing on the back tries to compensate, but it is not as well done as the Ultrasharp series.-No USB hub.-OSD is not as good as the UltrasharpFinal thoughts: I take back the negative things I have to say about quality control for this specific monitor, because it seems they all have lemons, and I was just unlucky several times in a row.  I stand behind the new cons though.I give the panel 4/5 stars because it took 3 tries to get a perfect one.

"597","After unboxing the PB238Q I used it as a second monitor on my MacBook Retina which is the hardest competitor you could imagine. But I am think I searched long enough and found what I was searching for. I wanted to have a IPS panel with the latest plugs (HDMI, DVI, maybe USB) This device came with all that and had as well speakers included. So lets go with it. The unboxing wasn't a big deal and I was surprised about the very stable foot. It came packed in the vertical way and I just had to rotate the monitor 90 deg. Then I realized that if you rotate it it is very useful to plug in all the cables. I have been to a store around here to by a HDMI cable. I need the regular plug for the MacBook but I would not need it for the PC which came a day later. What I mean is, there is a HDMI cable included but it is not the hexagon (standard) version it has only five corners!) Then the first star up  it took me a decade to find out how I can activate it unter my OS. And usually I am skilled with things like that. The problem was just, that I had do unplug it one more time and then plug it again. I don't know why he did not recognize it. The setup (same ICC profile) and adjustment to the monitor settings went very well and quick. Now they both look very similar. To be hones the PB238Q has no chance against a retina display the picture looks unsharp the color a little bit to saturated and the brightness of the retina is not reachable with the PB238Q. But lets be honest the PB238Q is a 200 $ device compared to a 1300 $ device it can never beat the Retina. (I just compared the price difference between the regular MacBook vs. the Retina and took the difference as a price for just the Retina display). This is just a suggestion not reality. So my opinion is that I got what I asked for. A cheap display with IPS technique, a quick response (gray to gray), 23 "" and pretty good reviews from other customers. I have got speakers, it has got USB ports on the left side, TCO5.2 and you can really deactivate it (that is important for me).

"602","Have been debating on upgrading my monitor setup for the past couple of months and finally settle with this. I originally had 2 AOC I2757 27"" 1080p monitors and they worked but lacked in many areas, after one started having screen tearing issues I decided it was time to try something different. I originally toyed with a 4k system but either due to most having only a 30hz refresh rate or being extremely expensive if they do have a 60hz rate, I shied away from those option. I also looked into 144hz monitors because I like to game every so often, I turned those down due to all are tn based panels and eventually wanting a dual monitor setup again I turned them down also. That leads only two option I could go with ultra thin bezel 1080p setup or 1440, guess what won. I probably looked through 10 youtube reviews before I decided on this particular model, mainly due to all the right options: matte screen, matte bezel, vesa mount(this sealed the deal), thin bezel, fully adjustable stand, great build quality. It's crazy that this monitor is almost a year old and still one of the best 1440 monitors. As far as hardware goes it does tax your video card quite a bit more. Gaming wise I would say you would need at least a 700 series card or 600 sli'd (no ideo on amd's sorry) to run this at medium + quality. I have a 690 and it handles everything on high pretty well, I tried titanfall on ultra and it started to get a little hairy and unplayable( I don't know if it was a driver issue or what).

"607","l have had this monitor for over a year now, and I've never had anything I wanted it to do that it couldn't. It delivers beautiful clarity, the saturation can go so over the top that you'll never want to put it above 85, and the finish on the screen never shows any reflections of the sunlight behind me, allowing it to have slightly lower brightness without it being dim. It is also very forgiving about smudges and fingerprints because of the finish. I have never cleaned it off and I noticed recently that it has many smudges on it that disappear once it's turned on.

"610","I have had this monitor for over a month now. My older 24"" monitor was demoted to wife duty (She uses her computer less than I. Obviously I asked her if she wanted a new monitor before I bought my new one.  :lol: ) After 2 days of use with my new monitor I installed my old monitor on my wife's computer. When she turned it on and booted Windows, I realized just how bad my old TN panel with .27mm pixel pitch was.The Asus PB278Q has a great viewing angle just like IPS panels. The PLS panel is identical in this regard.The higher resolution, which is 4 times that of standard high definition standards, is very clean. Gaming is very nice with clean edges and textures. The response time is good but the monitor is natively 60Hz. There are tools which allow this monitor to run at 85Hz but most users report jittery image. Running it at 75Hz works without issue.Back light bleed is decent but not perfect. When the monitor's brightness is set higher there is some bleed in the lower left corner. Luckily higher brightness levels are undesirable to me. At what I find to be a normal brightness level the back light bleed is indiscernible.The anti glare is called a semi gloss. I hate any form of anti glare. Anti glare diffuses the light coming through the pixels. This monitor isn't as bad as some of the Dell monitors. Removing the coating may be something in my future. I enjoy glossy monitors however I always put lighting behind the monitor and not in front of it. Primary use will be in a room with only the light behind the monitor.The stand is nice. The swivel base is a bit gimmicky. Basically it's just a wheel they added on after the fact so they can say it swivels. It doesn't seem to cause issues but I feel like it doesn't aide the swivel action what so ever.The OSD menu is standard in its use and layout. The options are nice enough. I will be able to calibrate it and make any adjustments needed in the OSD menu. There are no phase controls but I haven't seen too many issues with phase. No geometry controls either however most modern LCDs to not need adjustments in this department.I haven't checked the color yet. I will be calibrating it and checking the color soon. I will report back with my findings and results. 100% of sRGB color space isn't anything special but with some adjustments this monitor should be decent. If you need to color match for commercial work this monitor might not be for you. For movies, gaming and some light graphical work the color has plenty of punch.[EDIT]Color Calibration[/EDIT]I just ran Pantone's Huey S5 Pro calibrator on the ""User"" profile I had setup and the ""sRGB"" profile. Ticking the before and after/preview button revealed a slight difference on both profiles. I think the biggest difference is in the brightness levels.

And people who say the buttons on the back are horrible, there are markers for the buttons themselves so your not blindly looking for hours on end.

The 970 on almost max settings in assassins creed held at about 45-50 fps. That's not even in SLI!

"626","I've had this display a couple months. I replaced a previous ASUS 1920x1080 27"" monitor with this one. I was looking forward to the higher resolution display and I have not been disappointed with that. It works with the mid-spec 2GB nVidia 630 video card without any problems. The blacks aren't quite as black as I would like them, but it's a nice monitor with great resolution for the price.My one complaint is the on-screen display (OSD) timeout for displayPort. I have a new work laptop that requires me to use a KVM switch with this monitor. The KVM is a little older and doesn't support dual link DVI. OK, that's the KVM's problem, so I just used the KVM for the keyboard and mouse and plugged the laptop into the displayPort connector of the monitor. I use DVI for my main PC and displayPort for my work laptop. That works alright except after 2 hours the OSD goes to sleep under displayPort, no matter what. This puts the laptop to sleep and causes some annoying issues when I wake it about LAN timeouts. This didn't happen with the older 27"" monitor.

"636","This is a great monitor! I understand some buyers have had some issues with dead/stuck pixels but I have not had an issue with resolving those problems. As far as I can tell I have found only ONE actual dead pixel. I did have quite a few (I'd say around 10 or so but they're very small and it's quite a lot of real estate to scan) stuck pixels but that was quickly remedied with a light press of a finger against the screen in the area that the pixel was in! All but one or two of the stuck pixels were on or near the outer perimeter of the screen. As for the one dead pixel I have found it is a great panel! Unless you are trying hard to find it, it is absolutely unnoticeable. Color correction is great and the response time (4ms) is pretty good for a non TN panel. I use this monitor mostly for gaming and care more for color quality than refresh rates. I know a lot of professional/competitive First Person Shooter gamers want the awesome 120-144hz refresh rates but for a person who games just for the sheer enjoyment this monitor is great. It has been out long enough now in my opinion to merit the asking price.

"637","First of all - no major cons. I am joining all the 5 stars reviews and there is not much I can add.Comes with DVI, HDMI (single not dual, but should support maximum resolution), Displayport, analogue. I checked all and all work. Maximum resolution is 2560x1440. Make sure  that your OS can drive the video card.My Zotac with AMD Radeon HD 6310 with Ubuntu 12.04 worked when I connected the cable.  My Zotac supports the native resolution only via DisplayPort. I could not drive more than 1920p via HDMI (the display should support this). I did not try to fix Xconf, but I read that it is possible. When you connect DisplayPort to the monitor make sure that you hear 'click' sound - took me half an hour to figure out why displayport does not work.I run the online test and this display is the best LCD I have ever owned, but this is not really hard because I always buy lower end. No dead pixels, no stuck pixels (I have bought open box product and there is always risk). The screen is just barely warm after hours of work. Comes with all cables. Adjusting monitor position is very easy and smooth, portrait mode - in one word excellent.To say that  27"" of real estate and 2.5K pixels is enormous (I am a software developer) is to say nothing at all. To really appreciate the display you should run some HD with deep black scenes.Display does decent job when in lower than native resolution. I would not work with text in not native resolution. Display does not support picture in picture mode (two PCs connected simultaneously) as some higher end displays do.I did not try any calibration and display comes with default 50s in the color settings (not calibrated).  I do not have required tools anyway to calibrate the display and the display looks very good as it is.Sound is decent, but not great.

"642","I'm every bit as impressed with this display as I am with my 27"" iMac. The matte finish makes it much more usable in my opinion since it greatly cuts down on glare. I have it connected to a DisplayPort KVM switch and I have no trouble getting the maximum resolution from my mac book air and Windows 7 laptop as long as I use only DisplayPort components. My first shot using DisplayPort to DVI and DisplayPort to HDMI adapters was NOT successful. I really like the headphone jack on the display.

"644","I was looking for a monitor that I can use in vertical position mainly for reading and one that I can use for hours without eye fatigue. This monitor works just fine for me.Even though it uses PWM, different from most of the monitors in this price range, it has a high frequency PWM that is not noticable, hence puts no stress on your eyes after constant use for hours. But please note that I am not  so sensitive to flickering, so if you have a medical condition, situation can be different.Another important topic is the crisp screen. Since screens with heavy coating disperses the text, coating was one of the major critertia for me. This monitor has very light coating which preserves the sharpness of the text, also the existence of light coating is useful as it successfully avoids all non-major reflections.I have also watched movies and edited photos (although as an amateur) on this, and compared to my old laptop, colors are very vivid and natural. Although I have no idea what a professional photographer would think.I guess if you are looking for a monitor for long hours of reading and/or coding, for which vertical position is very useful, and also for one that you can use daily for watching movies and simple photo editing, in this price range, this is a very good alternative.",3,10,7,13,76.9230769230769,23.0769230769231,"    looking   monitor   can use  vertical position mainly  reading  one   can use  hours without eye fatigue  monitor works just fine  meeven though  uses pwm different     monitors   price range    high frequency pwm    noticable hence puts  stress   eyes  constant use  hours  please note       sensitive  flickering      medical condition situation can  differentanother important topic   crisp screen since screens  heavy coating disperses  text coating  one   major critertia    monitor   light coating  preserves  sharpness   text also  existence  light coating  useful   successfully avoids  nonmajor reflectionsi  also watched movies  edited photos although   amateur    compared   old laptop colors   vivid  natural although    idea   professional photographer  thinki guess    looking   monitor  long hours  reading andor coding   vertical position   useful  also  one   can use daily  watching movies  simple photo editing   price range     good alternative

"649","I love this display. The features and specs at this price beat all other options and brands at the time of my purchase. Despite lack of any reviews and ratings at the time, I am very glad I took the risk and purchased this product.The adjustable stand is very mice and solid. The speakers aren't the best, but good enough for general use (for watching video or listening to music I switch the output to my mini bookshelf audio system).The USB hub functionality is pretty handy. I'm only using the 2 ports hidden under/behind the display. One for a wireless mouse dongle and the other for a Bluetooth dongle. The reason I chose this arrangement is that there won't be any additional cables running out of the monitor, and the dongles will be closer to what they are communicating with with less obstacles in between (compared to when plugged to the back of the computer case).I initially found the color a bit too warm compared to my older Dell display (which sits next to it now), but later discovered that actually that is the more accurate color. I later learned that LCDs tend to be a bit bluish in color and since my eyes were used to that the new ASUS felt a bit too warm. This was confirmed when bought a screen calibrator, and calibrated both displays. The ASUS was much closer to the current calibrated state (I do a lot of photo editing in Lightroom, that's why I eventually decided to get a calibrator)I should also mention that the buttons on the front bezel may not look very attractive if you look at the pictures, but that's because of the lighting which accentuates the buttons. In practice you cannot even tell that the buttons are there.Overall, a great product.

"717","This monitor is bright, consistent, and flexible.  It's a near optimal size for desktop work and even near-room video viewing.  Picture quality is near perfect, including color rendition (there is a more expensive color-corrected ""A"" series for professional use, but this model has the truest colors out of the box I've ever seen).  The monitor is responsive, or at least looks that way when the younger user plays his flying and shooting games via ATI Radeon.The monitor pivots, swivels, tilts, and rotates, which means you can change the horizontal viewing angle, vertical angle, height, and rotate the screen.  My previous experience with rotating screens was on 4:3 aspect ratio models, on which portrait mode was perfect for document composition and some spreadsheet work.  The 16:9 rotated mode is more narrow, and in portrait mode it's long, long trip visually from top to bottom.  For document work, my personal preference is to stay in landscape.  One specific nicety is the ability to fit 100 mint.com transactions in one screen, at native resolution.The menu system offers a huge number of range of color, brightness, and other adjustments.  One minor quibble is that the on-screen adjustment menus are not the easiest to navigate, but I find I rarely if ever have a need to access those controls. The monitor wakes up, syncs, and works consistently on both analog and digital inputs. This monitor does have an HDMI input along with DVI, analog, and Display Port.As Marge used to say in the commercials, ""you're soaking in it'""; this review was written on this monitor.",2,14,12,16,87.5,12.5,"   monitor  bright consistent  flexible    near optimal size  desktop work  even nearroom video viewing  picture quality  near perfect including color rendition     expensive colorcorrected  series  professional use   model   truest colors    box ive ever seen   monitor  responsive   least looks  way   younger user plays  flying  shooting games via ati radeonthe monitor pivots swivels tilts  rotates  means  can change  horizontal viewing angle vertical angle height  rotate  screen   previous experience  rotating screens    aspect ratio models   portrait mode  perfect  document composition   spreadsheet work    rotated mode   narrow   portrait mode  long long trip visually  top  bottom   document work  personal preference   stay  landscape  one specific nicety   ability  fit  mintcom transactions  one screen  native resolutionthe menu system offers  huge number  range  color brightness   adjustments  one minor quibble    onscreen adjustment menus    easiest  navigate   find  rarely  ever   need  access  controls  monitor wakes  syncs  works consistently   analog  digital inputs  monitor    hdmi input along  dvi analog  display portas marge used  say   commercials youre soaking    review  written   monitor

"718","First, I will say that I'm an Asus fan. Typically their products are top notch and will fulfill your needs nicely. This monitor is their first attempt to compete with Dell's Ultrasharp IPS line while providing a better price for consumers. I was torn between the Dell 2713U and this monitor. After looking at prices and reviews I decided to save money and give this monitor a shot. The first one received had one stuck pixel and one dead pixel with excessive back light bleed from the upper right corner. But, thanks to Amazon's awesome return policy and the fact that Asus has a zero dead pixel policy, I quickly received another one about three days later. The second one was good to go with no pixel issues and the backlight bleed was better than the first. The construction is solid and the button controls easy to use with a switch on the fly function between modes (i.e. Theater, Scenic mode...etc.) The stand is pretty functional with adequate adjustability. I was thinking this would be a huge monitor on my desk but it turned out that I probably could have gone with a 30 inch : ( Oh well, I still am enjoying it and it was an improvement over my 24 inch TN panel. Although the color, clarity and resolution are not quite up to par with Dell's IPS panels, it does have a slightly faster response time and for $300 savings more than adequate color, clarity and resolution for me. Just think of the games I can buy with that $300 savings! : ) It also comes with the digital video input (DVI) cables which is nice. All in all, I would say if you have the money to burn go with the Dell. But, if your looking to save some doe and still have a solid upgrade just a step down from the Dell, look no further and pick up the PB278Q. Keep improving Asus and you will grab the trophy!",8,25,17,33,75.7575757575758,24.2424242424242,"  first  will say  im  asus fan typically  products  top notch  will fulfill  needs nicely  monitor   first attempt  compete  dells ultrasharp ips line  providing  better price  consumers   torn   dell u   monitor  looking  prices  reviews  decided  save money  give  monitor  shot  first one received  one stuck pixel  one dead pixel  excessive back light bleed   upper right corner  thanks  amazons awesome return policy   fact  asus   zero dead pixel policy  quickly received another one  three days later  second one  good  go   pixel issues   backlight bleed  better   first  construction  solid   button controls easy  use   switch   fly function  modes ie theater scenic modeetc  stand  pretty functional  adequate adjustability   thinking     huge monitor   desk   turned    probably   gone    inch   oh well  still  enjoying      improvement    inch tn panel although  color clarity  resolution   quite   par  dells ips panels     slightly faster response time    savings   adequate color clarity  resolution   just think   games  can buy    savings    also comes   digital video input dvi cables   nice      say     money  burn go   dell    looking  save  doe  still   solid upgrade just  step    dell look    pick   pbq keep improving asus   will grab  trophy

"729","Let me preface this by saying that I've never owned a display that was even close to this resolution.  So I don't have experience to give a fully ""qualified opinion"".  But it is still an excellent display in its own right.Now I was a bit worried, after reading some reviews on the internet, that it might have too much Input Lag or would flicker too much due to the PWM back-light.  But neither of those things are a significant factor because of my setup.Input lag might be more of a factor if I was running games at lower frame-rates.  But at 60fps or above its just not noticeable.  To eliminate the Back-light as a factor I simply bumped it up one notch to 100%, which means its on all the time, so it doesn't flicker.  Then I adjust the display through my video card's settings.  Note: this does cause it to use more electricity - 44W compared to ~24W at 50% brightness (which is rather dark IMHO).  But since this is replacing a display that consumed ~110W I consider 44W to be negligible.The Good points:High Resolution and Fairly large size.Bright display with Good Colors and Viewing Angles.Nice Range of physical adjustments; Tilt, Swivel, Height... etc.Solid Construction and doesn't wobble around.The Bad points:Price!  ~$700 is still allot of money.Some will miss extra USB ports (I do not).Some will also fault the OSD for lacking features.

"783","I bought this for my 2015 Macbook pro, to use as an external monitor.  The deal breaker was the text quality for me.My usage is primarily text editing, I want something crisp and easy on my eyes.Compared to my 27"" (2k) Apple IPS panel I am using at work, the contrast and the sharpness of text was looked inferior to me.I expected that the higher resolution would translate to excellent text quality, but it seemed a bit fuzzy and out of focus for me, esp. black text on white background.  I spent a day trying to tweak the settings, but could not get to a happy place.  The blacks were just not blackenough for me.  I did like the height/angle/swivel  adjustable stand.  Hated the adjustment buttons.Did not come with a Thunderbolt cable.My conclusion:  A 4k resolution panel in the 27-30"" range does not make much sense for a business user.  (Perhaps an expnsive IPS variant would work better). The high pixel count imposes severe demands on the video card, and you will have to accept a lesser quality panel technology.

"822","I got this at a pretty good price from Amazon Warehouse Deals. Some notes on what I saw.Condition - The box that it came in was a little beat up and it is obvious that it is repackaged. It is an AWS product, so this was completely expected. Everything inside was packaged well and nothing was rattling around. There was a scratch on the stand that I was not too happy about. The monitor itself was perfect. No dead pixels.Picture Quality - This was perfect. The screen is matte and has no reflections which makes it very good for work. The color is pretty good. The contrast leaves a bit to be desired though. For work, greys and whites tend to blend together and with the increased real estate of 4k, you see a lot more white than you're used to.Living with 4k - A lot of reviews mention small fonts. That is to be expected. There are some adjustments needed. [...] That link tells you how to make your fonts bigger. Set it to 150% and you'll get same sized fonts at a much better quality.

I used my boyfriends amazon prime account(this account) for fast shipping and it arrived beautifully! The ""like new"" description said small scratches on the stand, back and sides but I couldn't spot any areas of damage. There were no dead pixels or scratches on the screen so I was happy! I am not an expert on monitor specs but this met my size needs, had great picture and worked great!I got this monitor at the beginning of Jan 2015. It is now March 9th and about two weeks ago when i turned my computer on, the monitor had reset the color options and my monitor had an extreme red tint to it. I couldn't figure out what was going on and anytime i went into the menu settings to try to adjust it the color, it kept resetting, It went green then looked purple and was so dark from 0 contrast that i could hardly see what i was doing. None of the color temp presets or mode settings worked right. They would all have one color set to 100% with the others at 0 or they would all be at zero. We tested my boyfriends monitor on my computer and everything seemed fine. Then we tried my monitor on his computer as well and the color looked fine so we were stumped. We were concerned the gpu might be malfunctioning after a google search of similar issues suggested that but it didn't make sense since his monitor worked just fine. I googled what to set my RGB and contrast too for the best picture and then i went into user mode and manually set my colors to r- 95, g- 90, b- 90, contrast- 100 and brightness at around 60+ since I don't like it extremely bright and everything looked beautiful again. I was worried turning it off would reset it but it turned on and worked fine again...For about a week.......now EVERY time i boot up my computer the monitor settings have reset themselves to all zeros. It has been about 5 days of manually setting all the colors so i can use my computer. It is an easy fix and its annoying but i don't mind since I don't have any other issues. If it starts resetting itself while i am using my computer, then we will have a problem. I am really hoping it never gets to that point but you never know. I haven't bothered calling Asus since their support is supposed to be horrendous and I really don't want to spend an arm and a leg shipping it out to be repaired so i am hoping for the best. Monitors are really expensive and I got a great deal on this one and I am hoping it wont need to be replaced anytime soon but i would also love if it would stop resetting itself every reboot. I will leave the review at 3 stars for now and hope I don't have to lower it.Pros: Solid heavy stand, no light bleed, no dead pixels, height adjusts, monitor tilts to portrait (if you care about that, i never use it)Cons: color settings reset every boot, built in speakers (i leave them muted since i have speakers on my desk and didn't buy this for the speakers)I hope this was helpful in your decision!",18,33,15,51,64.7058823529412,35.2941176470588,"   couple months ago  decided  upgrade  parts   computer  bought  new power supply gpu extra ram  wanted  upgrade  monitor  well    dell  display  came   computer   first bought    still worked beautifully   wanted  get  bigger size   loved  idea    able  adjust height  boyfriend recently ordered  asus paq   loved   height adjusted   general look   monitor  wasnt thrilled  reviews   asus brand   complaints  customer service   saw  monitor   like new  amazon warehouse   went    used  boyfriends amazon prime accountthis account  fast shipping   arrived beautifully  like new description said small scratches   stand back  sides   couldnt spot  areas  damage    dead pixels  scratches   screen    happy     expert  monitor specs   met  size needs  great picture  worked greati got  monitor   beginning  jan    now march th   two weeks ago   turned  computer   monitor  reset  color options   monitor   extreme red tint    couldnt figure    going   anytime  went   menu settings  try  adjust   color  kept resetting  went green  looked purple    dark   contrast    hardly see     none   color temp presets  mode settings worked right     one color set     others         zero  tested  boyfriends monitor   computer  everything seemed fine   tried  monitor   computer  well   color looked fine    stumped   concerned  gpu might  malfunctioning   google search  similar issues suggested    didnt make sense since  monitor worked just fine  googled   set  rgb  contrast    best picture    went  user mode  manually set  colors  r  g  b  contrast   brightness  around  since  dont like  extremely bright  everything looked beautiful    worried turning    reset    turned   worked fine againfor   weeknow every time  boot   computer  monitor settings  reset    zeros      days  manually setting   colors   can use  computer    easy fix   annoying   dont mind since  dont    issues   starts resetting     using  computer   will   problem   really hoping  never gets   point   never know  havent bothered calling asus since  support  supposed   horrendous   really dont want  spend  arm   leg shipping     repaired    hoping   best monitors  really expensive   got  great deal   one    hoping  wont need   replaced anytime soon    also love    stop resetting  every reboot  will leave  review   stars  now  hope  dont   lower itpros solid heavy stand  light bleed  dead pixels height adjusts monitor tilts  portrait   care    never use itcons color settings reset every boot built  speakers  leave  muted since   speakers   desk  didnt buy    speakersi hope   helpful   decision

"874","I got my Asus PB287Q 4k monitor yesterday and started using it with my Mac Pro (Late 2013). Let me tell you: I am blown away. I used it with Aperture and colours, contrast, etc. seem all to work out of the box. There is a reason, why this screen got top ratings by Tomshardware.com.Nevertheless, a few issues arise with fine-tuning the resolution, hence the 4 stars:- If used alone, I get a max resolution of 3200x1800 @ 30Hz.- If I switch to DP1.2 in the monitor preferences, I get max 3840x2160 @ 60Hz, but then I get tearing/artefacts on the right hand side of the screen (apparently this is an Apple problem and is going to be resolved in 10.10), but effectively is useless- The only way to get max resolution of 3840x2160 @ 30Hz is to plug in an additional Full HD monitor via HDMI (I am not joking!)- There is no startup screen on the Asus (not really bothered by this)Update:After a week with the monitor, I have managed to get the max resolution at 30Hz: I used a mini DP to HDMI cable, rather than the mini DP to DP 1.2 cable.Consensus on the web is, that the tearing is a driver related issue, as people who have started up from Windows on the Mac Pro (via Bootcamp) do not have the tearing issue. When I chatted w/ Apple Support, they stated. that 4k was still in its infancy and I should be seeing improvements in the not too distant future.Thanks to Amazon support who sent me a replacement, as it was not initially clear if it was a monitor related issue (hadn't found any other information on the 3800 x 1800 resolution and was able to replicate it with the replacement unit).In the end, I decided to keep the monitor. The resolution is awesome, the stand is the best for these screens (compared to the other brands which use the same panel) and the Asus menu is very straight forward.LL",7,10,3,17,58.8235294117647,41.1764705882353,"   got  asus pbq k monitor yesterday  started using    mac pro late  let  tell    blown away  used   aperture  colours contrast etc seem   work    box    reason   screen got top ratings  tomshardwarecomnevertheless   issues arise  finetuning  resolution hence   stars  used alone  get  max resolution  x  hz   switch  dp   monitor preferences  get max x  hz    get tearingartefacts   right hand side   screen apparently    apple problem   going   resolved    effectively  useless   way  get max resolution  x  hz   plug   additional full hd monitor via hdmi    joking    startup screen   asus  really bothered  thisupdateafter  week   monitor   managed  get  max resolution  hz  used  mini dp  hdmi cable rather   mini dp  dp  cableconsensus   web    tearing   driver related issue  people   started   windows   mac pro via bootcamp     tearing issue   chatted w apple support  stated  k  still   infancy     seeing improvements     distant futurethanks  amazon support  sent   replacement     initially clear     monitor related issue hadnt found   information    x  resolution   able  replicate    replacement unitin  end  decided  keep  monitor  resolution  awesome  stand   best   screens compared    brands  use   panel   asus menu   straight forwardll

"960","When looking for a new monitor I kept debating whether to get a 24"" or a 27"".  I was concerned that maybe the 27"" would seem too big.  But now that I have it, I'm so glad I went for this.  Bigger is better!  My resolution is set to 1920x1080.  I tried 2560x1440 (need to use the display port cable) but everything was too small and hard to read.  Another thing to note about the display port cable, when I initially tried it, I didn't get any signal.  The solution turned out to be as simple as swapping the cable ends.  I took the end that was plugged into the monitor and plugged it into my video card and vice versa.Out of the box the brightness was set very high.  I had to dial it down to around 30.  But the image quality is very nice.  My only complaint is for the premium price this monitor sells for, I expected higher build quality.  This thing is mostly all plastic, and it doesn't seem like the sturdy kind.

"987","I was confused about the connections on the monitor; what ASUS calls Display Port my television and pc graphics card call HDMI.  The Asus HDMI cable wouldn't fit in my graphics card; the graphics card's HDMI connector has 2 beveled edges while the ASUS cable has only one.  I discovered that I had an unused HDMI cable plugged into my tv and it has the 2 beveled edges so I connected the monitor with that using the monitor's Display Port input.  That ended up being worse that connecting it with DVI?!  With Display Port the display was shrunk down and had a 1 inch black border around it.  So back to DVI I went.  Plus, with the Display Port connected the text was definitely blurry.  With DVI it's sharp.The USB hub in the monitor is USB 2, not USB 3.  So if you're connecting to a USB 3 on your pc you'll lose the advantages of USB 3.The speakers are really crummy sounding.  I'm using some ancient inexpensive Altec Lansing PC speakers (7 in / 18 cm high) that I've had for decades and they sound much better than the monitor's speakers.

"1035","*For the price* this monitor is great - 1440p, 60hz, and IPS result in a very good quality picture with very high resolution and good color accuracy and a decent framerate.  I'm not sure if it's accurate enough to use for graphic design or editing where color sensitivity is crucial, as I've not delved that deep into its accuracy, but for casual use and gaming it's plenty fine for my tastes, at least compared to prior monitors - white is no longer a tinge of yellow.  Viewing angle is great as well.Quality control, however, wasn't as good - and is the reason for 4 stars rather than 5.  I had to return the monitor twice until I got one that was acceptable, as the first had a very noticeable stuck pixel and the second had a line down the center anytime any video was played (regardless of input source).  Thankfully Amazon is AWESOME and replaced it, no questions asked, very rapidly.  I originally ordered the monitor 10 days ago today, decided to return it 3 days later (Sat.) and received the replacement on Tuesday.  Checked out the replacement monitor on Tuesday and found the line, then chose to replace it to on Wednesday and today (Thursday) I received the replacement, which appears to be perfect now (no stuck or dead pixels, no lines, and no light bleed).  6 stars to Amazon for their service & speed!Edit: turns out this one has some significant backlight bleeding, but not bad enough to replace again and risk another.

"1039","Update: 11/26/14:  Okay, I have built my PC system and have everything working.  As far as running this monitor from the PC side of things.  It's excellent.  The color is balanced, the text is sharp and pronounced, and everything just pops on the screen.  The text is still a little small, but with the correct settings in Windows, everything is perfect.  I would give this monitor 5 stars with the exception of one thing... It does not work out of the box when building your own PC system (at least when pairing this monitor with a Gigabyte X97-Gaming GT motherboard.The first night of my build, I installed everything in my case (Motherboard, CPU, Ram, etc), plugged my Display Port cable into my motherboard directly (using discrete graphics) and booted up.  Nothing (only a black screen with a blinking cursor).  Tried several things thinking it was my build.. After an hour, I decided to plug my computer into my TV using a HDMI port.  Voila... The screen came up perfectly.  For some reason this monitor does not work well with the Gigabyte Bios setup when using discrete graphics.  Long story short, after installing windows, and then installing my two GTX 970 graphics cards everything worked well (BIOS shows up correctly as well as all resolutions that I need).In the end, this is a fantastic monitor... My original one star review was based on my experience with my MacBook Pro (which if you have a 2012 model, you may be disappointed).  Otherwise, if you are thinking about a lower resolution monitor, I'd recommend this one in an instance (as long as you know how to fiddle with a few things to get it working).Update 11/2014:  I have updated my initial review from one star to 3 based on some information that I obtained from another Asus user.  It appears that this monitor does work the the MacBook Pro at 60 hz, just not the first Macbook Pro Retina.  I plan on building my PC system this weekend and I will see how this monitor performs on the PC side.  If everything looks good, I'll re-visit this review and update the stars as necessary.  As of now, despite the MacBook issue, I still feel that this monitor is a little washed out, and the viewing angles are not perfect, but this may change on the PC side.Original Review: According to the documentation on Asus' website, this monitor will work with a MacBook Pro Retina in 60 Hz.  However, no matter how much I try, I am only able to get 30 Hz (and my mac indicates that the picture is in low resolution mode).  Frankly, this monitor actually looks terrible.  I'm unable to find a viewing angle that brings out rich color.  Everything looks washed out unless I really tilt the monitor in a very exaggerated angle. The worst part is that the screen is extremely small and barely readable.  In order to properly see text, I have to change the resolution or magnify the text (in Microsoft Word / Safari) which caused everything to look jagged or pixelated.  Nothing is crisp. I also want to comment on how terrible the controls are on this screen.  You have to cup your hands behind the monitor to make adjustments (I turned off the monitor several times by accidentally hitting the wrong button because there is no real guide to what you're selecting).I'm giving the monitor one star for having a good stand.",8,24,16,32,75,25,"  update   okay   built  pc system   everything working   far  running  monitor   pc side  things   excellent   color  balanced  text  sharp  pronounced  everything just pops   screen   text  still  little small    correct settings  windows everything  perfect    give  monitor  stars   exception  one thing    work    box  building   pc system  least  pairing  monitor   gigabyte xgaming gt motherboardthe first night   build  installed everything   case motherboard cpu ram etc plugged  display port cable   motherboard directly using discrete graphics  booted   nothing   black screen   blinking cursor  tried several things thinking    build   hour  decided  plug  computer   tv using  hdmi port  voila  screen came  perfectly    reason  monitor   work well   gigabyte bios setup  using discrete graphics  long story short  installing windows   installing  two gtx  graphics cards everything worked well bios shows  correctly  well   resolutions   needin  end    fantastic monitor  original one star review  based   experience   macbook pro       model  may  disappointed  otherwise    thinking   lower resolution monitor id recommend  one   instance  long   know   fiddle    things  get  workingupdate     updated  initial review  one star   based   information   obtained  another asus user   appears   monitor  work   macbook pro   hz just   first macbook pro retina   plan  building  pc system  weekend   will see   monitor performs   pc side   everything looks good ill revisit  review  update  stars  necessary    now despite  macbook issue  still feel   monitor   little washed    viewing angles   perfect   may change   pc sideoriginal review according   documentation  asus website  monitor will work   macbook pro retina   hz  however  matter  much  try    able  get  hz   mac indicates   picture   low resolution mode  frankly  monitor actually looks terrible  im unable  find  viewing angle  brings  rich color  everything looks washed  unless  really tilt  monitor    exaggerated angle  worst part    screen  extremely small  barely readable   order  properly see text    change  resolution  magnify  text  microsoft word  safari  caused everything  look jagged  pixelated  nothing  crisp  also want  comment   terrible  controls    screen     cup  hands behind  monitor  make adjustments  turned   monitor several times  accidentally hitting  wrong button     real guide   youre selectingim giving  monitor one star    good stand

I love my VE247H but I gave it to my girlfriend and needed a new monitor (she games right beside me and I just gave her my old gfx card so perfect comparison setup).  As previously hinted at, I have my old monitor set up on an identical computer right next to me other than the fact I just installed r9 290 in my pc to support 1440p, but both systems run everything on max.""Test 1""So the first one I grab is the VS278Q-P.  New model, lower response time, 8x higher contrast (supposively); other than the slightly lower ppi what can go wrong?  Well, I get the monitor in, immediately hate the picture so I mess with some settings and get it decent, But sitting next to my older monitor it looked so washed out.  So I give it a couple days to ""grow on me"".  But no, still looks like crap compared to my old one, can't have that.  RETURNED""Test 2""Based on my last experience I decide just to focus on picture quality so I grab the PA248Q.  Initial Impressions; ""Damn this thing is small, and shiny!"".  Next to my old monitor this thing just looked small, yeah I'm aware of the aspect ratio differences, but either way what came across was small.  The reason I say shiny is because the screen looked really shiny even with the slightest light source on.  Picture was good... I guess, not really my style tho?  Needless to say...

"1056","Overall a nice enough monitor, using it right now. Taking points off for three things. One is the location of the controls, and their behavior in a dual-input setting. For example when the DP goes to sleep, and the HDMI is active. When the DP wakes up it doesn't automatically switch back. Have to do that manually every time.  And the last currently minor but still annoying is the monitor occasionally going briefly to blank and then back. It happened more with the original cable and the 60 Hz setting.

"1057","For the price, this is a superb monitor. I really love how ridiculously accurate the colors are. Images simply look more 3D on this monitor compared to my old TN panel because color gradients are properly displayed and the dynamic range on each individual color is not compressed.My only gripe is that there's no audio output for the HDMI, which means you can't, for example, use your XBOX 360 with your main speakers. The internal speakers are predictably pathetic although output is reasonable considering they're basically laptop speakers.If I had to nitpick, yes, the bleed through the lower right hand corner from the power LED can be annoying, but it's not noticeable under most circumstances.Viewing angles are not impressive, honestly. The colors change slightly very quickly off center. No better than any other monitor I've used, of course, TN panels have also gotten pretty good in recent years and come up to the level of IPS screens.Base is way better quality than I expected. Heavy, excellent construction. Swivel, tilt, height, and 90 rotational adjustments. Monitor bezel and buttons feel surprisingly high quality for the price.My unit arrived in perfect condition with no dead or stuck pixels.Note: calibration out of the box is terrible.

"1058","I recently purchased two of these for use with my Dell laptop (dual screen, extended desktop setup).  They are replacing two 10 year old Dell 1600x1200 flat panel monitors.  I loved those Dells, but I wanted something bigger.  I also considered buying Dell's 27"" WQHD monitors, but went with these ASUS ones instead primarily because they were 12% cheaper and they seemed to be very comparable in quality.I've been using my ASUS monitors for a week now and I love them.  The colors look great and the matte finish eliminates all glare.  As a computer programmer, I don't care at all about getting perfect ""calibrated"" color.  The colors look great to me--same as my old Dells.The built in speakers are nice because I can now get rid of my cheapo computer speakers which are ugly and take up desk space.  The monitor's speakers are 3W, which seems to be sufficient for my purposes (listening to music while I sit and work at my desk).The monitor stands are solid and they in position when you set them (my old Dell's would often slide to the lowest position).  The monitor stand's tilt and rotate works great.  I do wish they would raise up a bit higher.  Also, the swivel function is a little bit ghetto.  You basically have to rotate the whole base (though there is a mechanism that reduces friction to make this easier to do).These monitors do NOT have a USB built-in (my old Dells did).  This is a bummer to me, but it's a problem that I fixed easily by purchasing an external hub fo ~$15.  Now, I have the hub (slightly) cluttering my desk, but that takes up much less space that the speakers that I don't need anymore, now that I use the ones built into the monitor.I have my PC hooked into the DisplayPort ports and I recently bought a TV tuner box and hooked that up to the HDMI port on one of the monitors.  It works great, and it's really nice that I get both the picture and sound out of the monitor.Overall great monitor.

"1109","Assuming you don't have to mess with Asus's infamously weak customer support, this is a terrific buy. Hard to get a screen this good, this size, at this price. It's weak on controls, imo, but runs sRGB and adobeRGB and provides a really good pictue, with very good colors. Right out of the box the pic is too bright and too hot but once you set it to sRGB, it's great. The GtoG time of 5ms is fine for watching videos (streaming or otherwise). Some gamers might want faster but this isn't really a gamer's screen -- more for vids and pro photographers, and such.Asus id a great job of putting together a high quality, pro-class 27"" monitor with 2560x1440 res for less than $800. Asus did this by using Samsung's PLA technology, which would have made it a very expensive screen except that Asus cut back a few corners to hold the price down. For $800 or less, this is hard to beat.Biggest drawback is it doesn't provide a USB hub but you can get USB hubs any day of the week and cheaply, so it shouldn't bother omost folks that you don't have one built into the monitor--after all, a USB hub on a monitor is not screen relevent-- it'd just be another hub for usb.

Uncalibrated however the sRBG mode will be the most accurate out of the box.Cons:No remoteVolume and menu buttons don't light up on the monitor.Speakers are tinyASUS combined the volume up button with the brightness control button.In order to turn the volume up or down one must first touch the volume down button and then touch the volume up button.

"1337","I purchased this monitor to do web development and design work from my home. I'm used to using mac stuff: monitors and systems  always nice and always expensive (provided for by the companies I've worked for).I read about some of the inconsistencies of the Asus PB279Q, but was impressed by the reviews, features and price tag. So, I decided to give it a shot. Here are my arbitrary ratings when comparing it to some of the other gear I've used:Color: 8/10Clarity: 8/10Brightness: 8/10Newsflash: it doesn't feel like a $1000+ apple cinema display. It's not as sharp, bright and certainly doesn't render the color the same way. But for the price, the asus is pretty darn good. I think it's fine for professional photo editing and graphics, but (like i said) not the best.Problems: Yes, if I had to do it again, I might steer clear. The monitor I received has a very slight, but noticeable darkness to the bottom edge of the screen. I'm sending it back to Amazon for a replacement. I'll let you know if the next one is better. I think many people might not even care about the darkness, but I do. I attempted to take a photo to illustrate, but it doesn't really do it justice.

"1350","I would have given this monitor a 5 if the setup hadn't depended on the fact that I'm a very experienced engineer and software developer.I'm lately working as a software developer and wanted this monitor because of the 2560x1440 resolution.  I'm using an Asus ASUS X75A-DS51 and as anyone who uses a laptop will tell you, it's not necessarily so that a laptop can drive one of these hi-res monitors.So I contacted the manufacturer of the laptop and they informed me that the laptop has integrated Intel HD-4000 video graphics.  That means I can't change the graphics card.  The manufacturer also informed me that they couldn't find anything specific to the laptop that specifies the maximum resolution of the video graphics.  (The laptop's resolution is 1600x900 for the built in display.)  However the manufacturer was able to direct me to the Intel website where Intel specifies that the HD 4000 graphics will drive a 2560x1440 monitor. See: [...] So I bought the monitor on that basis and with particularly high hopes because both the laptop and monitor are manufactured by Asus.This monitor comes with an HDMI (and other cables), so I plugged it into my laptop.  The laptop could drive the monitor, but only at 1920x1200 (I think it was), not the full resolution even with the latest video driver from Asus.  This sent me on a long, long google-goose chase.  I actually found a way to set a custom resolution using the Intel Graphics and Media Control Panel application that comes with the laptop.  One has to accept the disclaimer that this might wreck the chips in the computer, or the monitor, but I think that's not likely because the monitor and chipset do both claim this resolution.Bottom line, this actually worked great.  I""m very happy with the monitor.  No bright single pixels that are forever on, at least no obvious ones.  I'm very finicky, so this means the monitor has nothing to distract my eye.Finally I'm posting notes I've written to myself about where I got all this information.

"1444","My Use Case: I'm a Web Developer / Designer and I recently purchased a 2012 Mac Pro with the intent of building a mega rig with at least 3 displays, with the option to do more and it not cost more than a nice car.I bought 2 refurb . open box displays.  They were packaged differently and actually came via two different couriers. Initially they seemed smaller than I thought, but it's mostly because the bezel is so small.  The screen is exactly the same size as my Apple 27"" Cinema Display.  When first setting up the menus are a bear, but once you figure out that the buttons sort of work like the ATM buttons (labels are displayed above each button) it makes sense.  It comes with plenty of cables, very nice.  Display port, HDMI and a DVI to hdmi adapter.  The stands are very nice, easy to adjust, I recommend turning them 90 degrees to plug in your connections, then rotate back.4k Displays are new to me.  I first plugged one into the Mini Display Port of my gt120 graphics card that comes stock with many Mac Pros.  And to my surprise it will run it as full resolution!  However, that's almost impossible to use, everything is too small.  It would also  run it at 1080p HiDPi mode as well.  This is where the interface is like a 1080p display, but the text, photos, and edges are all rendered at full resolution.  I fought with Switch ResX hoping to get a better display mode, but no luck, and even still I was only getting 30hz.  So I bought a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 . This card is perfect for these displays, it has 3 Display Ports and will drive all of the display modes, I'm running a 3008 x 1692 HiDPi mode right now.Only complaint would be the speakers, garbage, utter garbage... but I bought a display, not speakers.

"1455","Physically, I like the design. I thought this would be a great monitor. The image quality is nice. What's not nice is the annoying buttons on the back. No labels and no dedicated buttons for anything. Once you do figure out which buttons do what, it's hard to push the tge corect buttons from any slightly off angle since they're on the back, and not super far apart! You would think with so many inputs, this monitor would have a dedicated source button. Or at least work well with multiple sources via auto switch based on signal or something. Nope. My old super cheap Asus display as well as other recent less expensive Asus models have the dedicated button, but not this one. Huge minus if you need to switch sources frequently.Aside from annoyance, the monitor malfunctioned pretty much constantly. I spent hours trying to work the kinks out. Essentially if I switched to my second computer, the thing would freak out for a while. It would act like no signal was found until I power cycled it a few times. I tried different cable options: Display port and hdmi..to no avail. When the freak out would happen, I'd also be unable to use the menu to manually switch sources, it would keep trying to find signal and flash the screen, ignoring all of my input.  Enraging way to spend $680 and hours of free time. So I sent it back and ordered an Acer with a dedicated source button.

"1515","Cons:Incompatible with Apple computers.  -Technically it works, but it won't give you the native 2560 x 1140 (WQHD) resolution you're looking for. When plugged into an Apple computer (via HDMI or DisplayPort), the monitor will give you what looks like standard definition (even though it says it's at the native 2560 x 1440 resolution). The only way to get a ""higher"" resolution is to use Apple's scaling settings. But for professional graphics, you probably don't want a scaled image. So it's not really a replacement for a Thunderbolt display. It may work fine with PCs, but Apple has decided to make their products nearly unusable with others' products. I have a late 2013 MBP. The Apple techs tried to tell me the issue was that the HDMI cable can't transfer information at the same rate as their Thunderbolt cables, which is a complete lie. Perhaps they've limited the data transfer rate on the MBP's HDMI port, but HDMI cables (good ones) can transfer up to 45 GBPS (at present), which is more than twice the 20 GBPS rate of Thunderbolt cables. Out of the box colour calibration not great. It's OK, but not really at a professional level, which is what I'd expect in a ""Professional Graphics Monitor"" Design/appearance is a little clunky. Definitely functional and not the ugliest thing out there, but not exactly a work of art either.Pros: Fantastic adjustability. Viewing angles are great and the vertical adjustment ensures that you can work all day without straining your eyes or neck. Price was great too ($469.99 USD when I bought).Bottom Line:This is probably a great monitor if you have a PC. If you're a professional working with a Mac, don't get this. The monitor is good, but Apple restricts their devices' connectivity.

"1519","I bought this monitor to hook up to my gaming/3d design laptop since the tiny 17"" widescreen laptop was straining my eyes. It was GREAT! Setup took all of 10 minutes (most of that was unpacking). I noticed no dead pixels or strange bleeding of any kind on this unit. I do 3D modeling and work with photoshop so the higher resolution was desirable but not enough to warrant the price. Being able to make the monitor taller, tilt it, and even completely rotate it was GREAT. I have had monitors in the past that were height adjustable but this monitor had most of the adjustments that I could want. I ended up returning this unit due to the poor quality and positioning of the speakers in the monitor. If removing the speakers would lower the price on the monitor then I would say do it! The speakers threw sound directly out the back of the monitor, AWAY from the listener, making it useless to try to use that feature even at the highest volume. Please note that I WAS NOT using it for music or looking for quality surround sound in games either, I know the limits of a two speaker system included in a monitor. I simply used it to watch a video that produced only voice speakers and I was unable to hear the people speaking. This is a bit unacceptable. I would rather pay less for a unit that had no speakers at all. I have gone through a lot of monitors in my time and despite the speaker issue I almost convinced myself to keep this monitor. In the end I felt the price for the ""features"" they included wasn't justifiable. I will wait for one without extra features that I don't need and/or are inadequate.Pros:- Resolution was wonderful- Adjustable height, tilt, and complete rotation- Great viewing angles- Easy to get set up- Fast response in games- Zero noticable glare- Everything the average user needs comes with it- HUGE!!Cons:- Horrible sound that could have been left off this unit",12,11,-1,23,47.8260869565217,52.1739130434783,"   bought  monitor  hook    gamingd design laptop since  tiny  widescreen laptop  straining  eyes   great setup took    minutes     unpacking  noticed  dead pixels  strange bleeding   kind   unit   d modeling  work  photoshop   higher resolution  desirable   enough  warrant  price  able  make  monitor taller tilt   even completely rotate   great    monitors   past   height adjustable   monitor     adjustments    want  ended  returning  unit due   poor quality  positioning   speakers   monitor  removing  speakers  lower  price   monitor    say    speakers threw sound directly   back   monitor away   listener making  useless  try  use  feature even   highest volume please note     using   music  looking  quality surround sound  games either  know  limits   two speaker system included   monitor  simply used   watch  video  produced  voice speakers    unable  hear  people speaking    bit unacceptable   rather pay less   unit    speakers     gone   lot  monitors   time  despite  speaker issue  almost convinced   keep  monitor   end  felt  price   features  included wasnt justifiable  will wait  one without extra features   dont need andor  inadequatepros resolution  wonderful adjustable height tilt  complete rotation great viewing angles easy  get set  fast response  games zero noticable glare everything  average user needs comes   hugecons horrible sound     left   unit

"1554","This is an incredibly horrific ""4K"" monitor. The color accuracy and clarity of the panel is embarrassing for ASUS and whoever else uses the panel.Color accuracy was not good at all and everything was washed out. I even used a Spyder calibration tool/software with it. While it made the monitor look better than it did out of the box, it was in no way comparable to a good IPS monitor (such as ASUS' PB278Q), 4K or not.I expected so much more from a 4K monitor in terms of clarity. It almost seemed as if ASUS tried to do some pixel magic to make the panel appear to be 4K. I am getting better clarity from the ASUS PB278Q, even though it's 2K.Also, the monitor isn't VESA compliant and the displayport cable they ship with it isn't either. 99% of the time, the monitor refused to wake from sleep.

"1586","This review is a combo of the bad description of the item I received from Warehouse Deals, and the bad customer service of Asus.This monitor was good in theory, bad in practice. I purchased it from Warehouse Deals, with the  ""Condition  Used - Very Good  Item is in original packaging, but packaging has damage. Cosmetic damage (Less than 5% ) on the top of the item."" description. This however does not describe what I received. First the shipping box had noticeable dents and deformations, not really Amazons fault, but the box used was also too big for the box the monitor was in, so it could shift around inside. Next the box that actually contained the monitor was not original packaging but a generic brown box with no brand labels at all. Inside the box was a big bubble sleeve thing that everything was in, but that offered almost no actual securing of the product in place, everything could move easily. Upon opening this sleeve I discovered the base/stand and power cables that had been included were just loosely put inside the sleeve with the monitor. The monitor itself was just covered in a plastic bag to prevent direct screen contact.I was first a little bothered by the lack of cables, it only came with a power cable and was supposed to include one of each video cable as well. Next the base/stand didn't look anything like the product pictures, and came with three small mounting screws. Once I actually looked at the parts I discovered they were indeed not the base and stand designed for the monitor at all. So now I was left with the screen itself, at least this worked. I was able to power on the screen with the power cord and plugged it in to my PC to test it, didn't have any dead pixels and lighting seemed fine. There were some finger prints on the screen before I even took it out the plastic bag it was in but they were removable.I contacted Amazon support to see if I could get a replacement since clearly I couldn't use a monitor without a stand, but since it was a Warehouse Deal item they couldn't issue replacements. They gave me the option to 1: return it for a refund and get free 1 day shipping on a new order. 2: keep it as is and get a 25% refund, 3: just return it for a full refund. I'm fine with that, Amazon did what they could.So I reached out to Asus support to see if they could offer some replacement parts and I could just take option 2 from Amazon. First I chatted with a representative who told me to contact Amazon for a replacement, when I told him I had and they couldn't he told me to email another support to ask for replacements. I asked for confirmation that they would have the stand/base and he said they would. Well I submitted a technical ticket, and two emails to different support emails. And in reply I got two emails basically saying the same thing, I needed to go to outside vendors for replacement parts. Even though the monitor I received is less than a year old and under all warranties they won't send replacement parts. The second email was even from the same CS rep I chatted with before telling me I had to contact Amazon again. . .So I decided to dumb the headache and go with option 1 from Amazon, I picked up another monitor of slightly lesser size and resolution and had free 1 day shipping put on that order.In conclusion I wish Warehouse Deals had not listed it as this condition when it clearly wasn't, I wish Asus CS had stood by their own words, but I will thank Amazon CS for being decent and trying to right the situation. 2 stars because the monitor seemed nice, but everything about it was horrible.",14,24,10,38,63.1578947368421,36.8421052631579,"   review   combo   bad description   item  received  warehouse deals   bad customer service  asusthis monitor  good  theory bad  practice  purchased   warehouse deals    condition  used   good  item   original packaging  packaging  damage cosmetic damage less      top   item description  however   describe   received first  shipping box  noticeable dents  deformations  really amazons fault   box used  also  big   box  monitor      shift around inside next  box  actually contained  monitor   original packaging   generic brown box   brand labels   inside  box   big bubble sleeve thing  everything     offered almost  actual securing   product  place everything  move easily upon opening  sleeve  discovered  basestand  power cables    included  just loosely put inside  sleeve   monitor  monitor   just covered   plastic bag  prevent direct screen contacti  first  little bothered   lack  cables   came   power cable   supposed  include one   video cable  well next  basestand didnt look anything like  product pictures  came  three small mounting screws   actually looked   parts  discovered   indeed   base  stand designed   monitor    now   left   screen   least  worked   able  power   screen   power cord  plugged     pc  test  didnt   dead pixels  lighting seemed fine    finger prints   screen   even took    plastic bag       removablei contacted amazon support  see    get  replacement since clearly  couldnt use  monitor without  stand  since    warehouse deal item  couldnt issue replacements  gave   option   return    refund  get free  day shipping   new order  keep     get   refund  just return    full refund im fine   amazon    couldso  reached   asus support  see    offer  replacement parts    just take option   amazon first  chatted   representative  told   contact amazon   replacement   told      couldnt  told   email another support  ask  replacements  asked  confirmation      standbase   said   well  submitted  technical ticket  two emails  different support emails   reply  got two emails basically saying   thing  needed  go  outside vendors  replacement parts even though  monitor  received  less   year old    warranties  wont send replacement parts  second email  even    cs rep  chatted   telling     contact amazon     decided  dumb  headache  go  option   amazon  picked  another monitor  slightly lesser size  resolution   free  day shipping put   orderin conclusion  wish warehouse deals   listed    condition   clearly wasnt  wish asus cs  stood    words   will thank amazon cs   decent  trying  right  situation  stars   monitor seemed nice  everything    horrible

"1641","I was not impressed with the 'amazing' colors that were supposed to be there because of the PLS panel on this monitor. My $120 ASUS monitor that was next to it had better colors than this one did. That is after extensive color calibration (on this monitor, not the cheap one.)On top of that, the monitor that I had received was defective. It had very very hard color distortion on the right half of the screen every once in a while. I conducted that it was definitively this monitor because it had the distortion even when there was no input plugged in.Many games and programs did not have the proper scaling, and UI elements were just simply too small. Yes, I had slightly gotten used to its added sharpness, and yes, going back to a 1080p panel seemed a little big, blocky, and blurry. That did not help my decision in going back to high refresh rate 1080p for everyday use. Everything that we know and love today is just about setup with 1080p in mind. At this very point in time, I would go for a really nice 1080p panel rather than a really budget 1440p, 1600p, or 4k panel at this time.

"1647","It's a good monitor, but not great. The first one I received had a bright pixel near the middle of the screen. Amazon made the return process very easy, since UPS arrived with a replacement the next day, when I had mine ready to hand to him. The first monitor also suffered from pretty bad light bleed, and unfortunately the replacement did too. It's not too bad from a straight-on viewing angel, but gets worse as angels change.The Apple 27"" Thunderbolt display I use at work has a much better display.

"1655","So far, I have a mixed reaction. It was delivered from Amazon in two days, fantastic. The box came damaged and open, not good. The monitor is not harmed, so that is wonderful. The instructions are not in English and are about the worst instructions that I have ever seen. But, it was not so hard to put together. Pivoting the monitor was rather scary because you have to turn it rather hard, and since part of it is plastic, I was afraid it was going to break. Keep in mind that i am comparing this to what I think would have happened if I had ordered the Apple computer instead. My computer is suppose to come tomorrow, so I still have to hook this monster to the computer. I don't have anyone else to share this with, so Amazon folks have to suffer with me :).one week later:I have had this monitor for over a week now. It is a beautiful monitor. The picture for me is crystal clear and the colors are great. It is working very well in all of the applications I want.

The only way to switch back to my Mac is to unplug the DisplayPort cable, manually switch the monitor to DisplayPort as the input, and then quickly plug the DisplayPort cable back in.While I haven't tried it without other display inputs being active, I believe it would still be a problem even if I only used my Mac as the sole display input.

"1689","I wanted to love this monitor, and if it worked, it would be pretty great. The size is a perfect match for a 27"" iMac.Sadly, it doesn't work for me, and after looking all over the Internet, it seems there are thousands like me. Apparently Asus monitors don't work well on Macs, and are plagued by the ""No Signal"" problem (google it). My monitor doesn't wake from from sleeping about 50% of the time. I need to unplug and plug back in the monitor in order to get it to work again.Asus support was disappointing as well. Instead of trying to troubleshoot the problem, after not even listening to my problem, they said I needed to return it.

"1699","Be forewarned!  If you work in Photoshop CS6 this monitor causes the menus and text to be displayed in minuscule type in CS6!  I mean like 2-point typeface!  One would go blind working in such small type.  This is not a fault of the monitor itself but of Adobe who will not release a fix for 4K monitors, if I am understanding the problem correctly.  I have searched the internet for a solution but can't locate a fix - just a lot of complaints from Photoshop users like myself complaining of the same problem.But on the bright side of things - this monitor is a real beauty in all the other programs I work with.  Beautiful pictures and type clarity is wonderful.  The above problem seems confined to Photoshop CS6 so if you don't use that particular program you will love this monitor.  You will probably have to do a little tweaking of the control to get it to your liking but there is a User Manual that one can download from the internet.  In my mind, the User Manual SHOULD have come boxed with the monitor. Just another cheap way to get us all to use our own ink, paper and time to print it.Another reason I am giving this monitor a 3-star review is the 6' cables that came with it.....I need at least 9' cables (would prefer 10' cables) for everything to reach.

"1701","I have owned this monitor for 10 months now and I've grown to dislike photography because of it.  Every day I am working in Photoshop and color accuracy is very important to me.  When I first got this monitor I used my Spyder2 calibrator to adjust this monitor, but that tool did not give me good results so I decided to order the Spyder4pro.  Same results with that calibrator, dull colors and it looked like the screen was covered in honey.  so my next step was to order the X-Rite i1Display Pro.  And the results were the same, dull colors, very little contrast and an extreme warm color cast.  I have been used to color calibrators warming up the screens a bit, but not too the point of looking brown.So my next step was going to TFT Central and using their color profile and monitor settings (quick note, why does Asus respond to reviews suggesting that users go to Tftcentral, why don't they just have something on their own page), but since I am not using the same system video card, the colors were off again.  I have basically reverted back to the stock settings of the monitor so I can at least get some work done.  But I know that when I visit my graphic artists friends at their workplaces, I look at my photos and I can see how the color is off.  this also happens when I order prints and receive them.I think one of the main problems is the brightness of this monitor.  it does start to look better if I set the brightness to about 70, but this is so bright that I start getting a headache within a few minutes.  I would say that it is the equivalent to staring at a 60 watt bulb from 2 feet away.  If I turn the brightness up all the way I can actually light my office pretty well.So, in order to avoid headaches and to save my vision I have to turn the monitor down to 30% and I am stuck with dull, lifeless colors.And what is my next step?  I guess I could save up my money and spend $1200 for a X-Rite i1Basic Pro 2.  That might be a little more accurate than the tools I have used but it is also expensive and since this monitor was supposed to be color calibrated before leaving the factory, I don't feel that spending $1200 to correct it is silly.  I could also live with the problem which would mean never having faith in my work and basically dread working on my photos.  or I can just save up for a new monitor.  saving up for a new monitor is the best option I think, but I know I might run into the same problem since many manufacturers are using the same panels (this one uses a Samsung LTM270DL02).  I might have to find one that uses an LG panel like the Apple products use.other than that I have had no issues with dead pixels or backlight bleed.  I do have to add however that the on screen controls are awful.

"1707","1440p is only available to 600 series nvidia and atitop line up[This is wrong as well sorry]. MY gaming desktop with nvidia gets 1440p, which is really nice.Gaming is nice at max settings.  The dvi cable that they supplied should display 1440p, if youhave a dvi connection capable.Need a good GPU to display 1440p.<<<< This is wrong sorry.  Tested on 5570HD radeon card on media pc;only works with DUAL LINK/dvi cable though, hdmi/DP didnt work(had black borders).Was hoping 1440p would display on all devices. 1080p is alright on some of my devices.Thought my new laptop gpu would work, guess not,believe it needs the new hdmi input.As for Color/contrast, its right on par with my syncmaster XL 2370 led( good tn panel I think). So I wasnt too amazed. If anyone has a good syncmaster, you know what I mean. My IPS LG TV 42(old tv)"" still beats this in color contrast, very lifelike, wasteful as heck in the WATTS.Gaming is nice in 1440p, no complaints there. Didnt notice ghosting. Asus has Trace Free option in Imagesetting, can fix Blurring/lag, if you notice any. Default is 60.  40 seems ok for me.Input lag is only at 16ms, its actually the lowest compared to others available 1440p samsung s27, dells 2711 2713(i tink those were model#s),nec, and view sonic vp. Others were ranging 20's - 30's might beghosting with those ones. Lag is more noticeable at 20-30s.Has no no sRGB emulation. Color accuracy isnt perfect.Its energy efficient which I like. Only 20-50 Watts, compared to Dell monster of a heater, but they haveLED version 2713 which is about the same as asus, dell has more lag though.Connections are nice and plenty, compared to the korean models, only have 1 DVI only. Don't thinkI want to risk 350-450$ without warranty.Bulky head connections might have trouble connecting in the back, kind of tight room. Doesntsit too flat against back.Onscreen menu OSD whatever, can be adjusted with BUTTONS! on panel, actual buttons. My other monitorshave touch sensor, can be very annoying.Comes with free wire connections. VGA,dvi, hdmi so forth.  Didnt receive anything else for FREE,like other people are stating free headset or something.The Design is ok, nice I suppose, can tilt up, can slide monitor too up and down, and whole base turns right or left, theres a round plastic plate under it. Its kind of stiff though, turning.  Dont know why people want to TILT A MONITOR UPWARDS! never seen anyone do that. I would like a DOWNwards much better and useful.  Actually it does tilt downwards hah(about 1-2 inch), not much but better than nothing.MY monitor is almost PERFECT screen. Bleeds white light at the bottom of the middle of screen,only noticeable if I hunch  down really low. Wasnt sure if I should return or get another or if its bad.Everything else is ok, as in clarity.All in all, I really wanted to display 1440p on all my computers :( .

"1719","I ordered this as an Amazon Warehouse deal because of the high price for only 27"". The reason I selected this monitor was because of its supposed higher resolution for graphic production. However, a warning to Mac Mini users... you probably will not be able to get more than 1080p. HDMI will only get you to HD resolution. You are supposed to be able to get a higher res via the Thunderbolt port and a DVI. This means ordering more cables and you still won't get the highest res available on the monitor.Now, about the ASUS: For this price, I expected a quality product, but was disappointed with the cheap feel of the body. The controls are difficult to use as they are under the bottom of the bezel and spaced far enough apart that you will need to use 2 hands to navigate through adjustments and settings. Calibrating a monitor with this set up is frustrating. The audio from the monitor is awful. Not that you would expect much, but the sound quality is so bad you want to turn it off. You can purchase a great HD tv for less than this cost and get better sound as well as picture and a remote to navigate the settings.Yes. This was a used item, but describe as ""like new"". That was not accurate. The scratches on the back of the monitor were pretty significant and elsewhere too. Not a problem for me because I just need the monitor to work well. It didn't. Only a couple of days after I received this product it quit working. I spent a lot of time mounting it on the wall above my desk and getting the right cables, calibrating and getting it set to my needs. Then it just wouldn't power on.Bottom Line: This monitor may be right for you and your computer. However, even though my Mac Mini has 2 graphics cards, video ram and 8GB of RAM I could not get the higher resolution advertised.
